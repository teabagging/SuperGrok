Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Eighteen months after disease onset, 40% of patients are found to still have anti-CHIKV IgM [6, 18, 23, 24] . The chronic stage of CHIKF is characterized by  polyarthralgia that can last from weeks to years beyond the acute stage [6] . CHIKV has been shown to attack fibroblasts, explaining the involvement of muscles, joints, and skin connective tissues. The high number of nociceptive nerve endings found within the joints and muscle connective tissues can explain pain associated with CHIKF [25, 26] . More than 50% of patients who suffer from severe CHIKF are over 65 y old, and more than 33% of them die. Most adults who suffer from severe CHIKF have underlying medical conditions [6, 24, 27] . The other group that is disproportionately affected by severe CHIKV is children. Other complications associated with CHIKV, from most common to least common, include respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure [6, 18, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27] . CHIKV undertakes a complex replication cycle upon host infection (Figure 2 ), which makes its genome susceptible to mutations [28, 29] . For instance, Ae. aegypti, responsible for epidemics in Kenya, Comoros, and Seychelles, carried CHIKV with an alanine in the 226 position of the E1 gene (E1-A226) [4, 18] . However, when the virus struck La Reunion Islands, a decline in population of Ae. aegypti, due to massive dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane usage and dearth of Ae. albopictus species' www.plosntds.org population, resulted in an ecological pressure, favoring replacement of alanine at position 226 with valine (E1-A226V) [5] . This mutation allowed CHIKV's secondary vector species, Ae. albopictus, to supplement Ae. aegypti as its primary vector [5] . Within a year, the E1-A226V mutation was present in La Reunion Island, and Ae. albopictus apparently vectored the large epidemic infecting 34% of La Reunion Island's population [5] . All of the CHIKV strains isolated from Mayotte carried the E1-A226V mutation, and the mutation was also found in Madagascar in 2007 [5] . The E1-A226V mutation was not present at the beginning of the Indian Ocean Islands outbreak (before September 2005). However, more than 90% of later viral strains found there had incorporated the mutation (December-March 2006), indicating a genotype switch during the winter season [5, 18, 20] . The E1-A226V mutation also enabled an increase in infectivity of Ae. albopictus when compared to its infectivity of Ae. aegypti [4, 11, 18, 30] , and with several factors taken together, Ae. albopictus has become the new preferred and more lethal vector for CHIKV [4, 5, 11] . In fact, Tsetsarkin et al. found that a Green Fluorescent Protein tagged E1-A226V virus was 100 times more infective to Ae. albopictus than it was to Ae. aegypti [4] . In all the Indian Ocean Islands, Ae. albopictus became the main vector for CHIKV within 1-2 y after CHIKV was introduced to the region [31] . Of note is that Ae. aegypti has most likely been established in North America for over 300 y, while Ae. albopictus has been in many areas of the US, since 1985, primarily in Florida [32] and since then has expanded its range in the country. Reiskind et al. set out to determine if Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes captured in Florida were susceptible to CHIKV infection by a La Reunion isolate [32] . Each mosquito tested was highly susceptible to infection by a full-length infectious clone of the La Réunion Island isolate, CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 strain. Even though the Ae. albopictus strains were more susceptible to infection, overall ecology and differences in human biting patterns need to be studied further Characteristically, there are two rounds of translation: (+) sense genomic RNA (49S9 = 11.7 kb) acts directly as mRNA and is partially translated (59 end) to produce non-structural proteins (nsp's). These proteins are responsible for replication and formation of a complementary (2) strand, the template for further (+) strand synthesis. Subgenomic mRNA (26 S = 4.1 kb) replication occurs through the synthesis of full-length (2) intermediate RNA, which is regulated by nsp4 and p123 precursor in early infection and later by mature nsp's. Translation of the newly synthesized sub-genomic RNA results in production of structural proteins such as Capsid and protein E2-6k-E1 (from 39 end of genome). Assembly occurs at the cell surface, and the envelope is acquired as the virus buds from the cell and release and maturation almost simultaneous occurred. Replication occurs in the cytoplasm and is very rapid (,4 h) [28, 29] . doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000623.g002 www.plosntds.org to gain a more accurate understanding of a potential CHIKV epidemic in the US [32] . During the 7 d preceding birth, no human mother has been reported to transmit the disease vertically. However, about 50% of newborns delivered while the mother was infected with CHIKV contracted the disease from their mother, despite the method of delivery. Furthermore, there have been instances of CHIKV transmission from mother to fetus causing congenital illness and fetal death [33] . During the 2005-2006 La Reunion Island outbreaks, Ramful et al. discovered that mothers could transmit CHIKV to their progeny during the perinatal period (Day 24 to Day +1) [33, 34] , and it is associated with a high degree of morbidity. By mean Day 4 of life, all of the neonates were symptomatic for CHIKV, exhibiting common CHIKF symptoms. Six neonates were confirmed to have contracted CHIKV and developed mengoencephalitis. Of those mothers who, during the La Reunion Island epidemic, were infected long before delivery, only three fetal deaths were reported [12, 33] . Ramful et al. theorized that motherto-child transmission most likely happens transplacentally shortly before delivery [33] . A similar study by Gerardin et al. reported nineteen cases of neonatal infection associated with intrapartum maternal viremia that progressed to develop encephalitis owing to vertical transmission from infected mothers [34] . Clinical and epidemiological similarities with dengue fever make CHIKV diagnosis difficult, which may lead physicians to misdiagnose CHIKV as dengue fever; therefore, the incidence of CHIKV may actually be higher than currently believed (Table 1 ) [6, 12, 35] . The amount of time elapsed since disease onset is the most critical parameter when choosing a diagnostic test. CHIKV can be detected and isolated by culturing with mosquito cells (C6/36), Vero cells (mammalian), or in mice [26] . However, this method can take at least a week and only achieves a high sensitivity during the viremic phase, which usually only lasts up to 48 h after the bite. Five days post-infection, the viral isolation approach has a low sensitivity but is still the preferred method for detecting the CHIKV strain [12, 26, 31, 35] . RT-PCR on the other hand is a faster and more sensitive method that can be used within the first week of disease onset [26] , and it is currently the most sensitive method for detecting and quantifying viral mRNA [4, 36] . Classic serological detection, by assays such as ELISA [37] , immunofluorescence [5, 38] , complement binding, and haemagglutination inhibition [39] , constitutes the second diagnostic tool used for biological diagnosis of CHIKV infection. These proven techniques are useful for detection of Antigen in mosquitoes during epidemiological studies. These assays detect virus-specific IgM and IgG, however the sensitivity and specificity of these assays has been poorly characterized. Viral competence, or the potential of viral infection and transmission, is an important parameter that can be quantified by ELISA, viral culture, and PCR. A study by Ng et al. showed biomarkers indicative of severe CHIKV infection [40] . They found decreased levels of RANTES and increased levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-1b (IL-1b) that could be sued for CHIKV detection in patients as indicators of CHIKV-driven cytokine storm. Couderc et al. demonstrate another cytokine, type-I IFN, as a key player in the progression to CHIKV infection [26] . Using an IFN-a/b null mouse model, they demonstrated evidence of muscles, joints, and skin as privileged CHIKV targets, which is consistent with human pathology. Although Ng et al. concluded that RANTES levels were significantly suppressed in severe CHIKF patients [40] , interestingly, an increase in levels of RANTES has been observed in dengue infection [41] . Since the symptoms of CHIKF mimic those of dengue fever, results obtained from this study strongly suggest that RANTES could be a potential distinctive biomarker that differentiates between these two clinically similar diseases. There are no approved antiviral treatments currently available for CHIKV [1, 3, 12, 42] . Currently, CHIKF is treated symptomatically, usually with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids, bed rest, and fluids. Movement and mild exercise are thought to decrease stiffness and morning arthralgia, but heavy exercise may exacerbate rheumatic symptoms. Corticosteroids may be used in cases of debilitating chronic CHIKV infection. There is a debate about the appropriateness of chloroquine as treatment for unresolved, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugresistant arthritis [43] . A study showed that viral production was www.plosntds.org drastically reduced at 16 h post-infection after treatment with 100 mM dec-RVKR-cmk (Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone), a furine inhibitor [42, 44] . Chloroquine acted by raising the pH, blocking low pH-dependent entry of virus into the cell. It is important to note that dec-RVKR-cmk or chloroquine only inhibited viral spreading from cell to cell, not CHIKV replication once it had entered the cell [43] . However, most would agree that the best weapon against CHIKV is prevention. A live CHIKV vaccine developed by the United States reached phase II clinical trial encompassing 59 healthy volunteers [45] . Eight percent of the volunteers experienced transient arthralgia, while 98% of the volunteers had seroconversion [45] . However, live CHIKV vaccines are still questionable. One cannot discount the risk of a live vaccine possibly inducing chronic rheumatism. Also, there is the question as to whether widespread use among the public could trigger mosquito transmission or lead to chronic infection or viral reversion [1] . An alternative approach would be to produce a chimeric vaccine against CHIKV. Wang et al. developed a chimeric alphavirus vaccine that is uniformly attenuated and does not cause reactogenicity in mice [3] . Three different versions of this vaccine were made using three different backbone vectors: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) attenuated vaccine strain T-83, naturally attenuated eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and attenuated Sindbis virus (SINV). In short, CHIKV structural proteins were engineered into the backbones of the aforementioned vaccines to produce the chimeras [3] . These chimeras were found to stimulate a strong humoral immunity, and even at doses of 5.3-5.8 log 10 PFU, they did not trigger reactogenicity. When vaccinated mice were challenged with CHIKV, neither adult nor neonatal mice gained weight, had fever, or displayed signs of neurological illness. Upon comparison of the chimeras with the Army181/25 vaccine, the Army vaccine resulted in higher levels of viremia and replication in the joints of neonatal mice. Because the joints are known targets of CHIKV, Wang et al. noted their vaccine might avoid the negative reactogenic side effects of the Army vaccine. After being subcutaneously vaccinated with 5.3-5.8 log 10 PFU of the chimeric vaccines, mice produced strong neutralizing antibody titers. The VEEV and EEEV chimeras yielded higher neutralizing antibody titers than the SINV chimera without being more virulent. On top of this, the VEEV and EEEV CHIKV chimeras seemed to be more immunogenic than the Army vaccine despite the chimeras' lower viremia and replication in the joints of neonatal mice [3] . Tiwari et al. [46] adopted a different strategy using formalin inactivated CHIKV in combination with alhydrogel (Aluminum Hydroxide) as an adjuvant. This study clearly suggests that this vaccine elicits both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice, providing its immunogenic potential. A recent study by Couderc et al. [47] showed passive immunization as a potential treatment for CHIKV infection. Using purified immunoglobulin extracted from convalescent CHIKV patients, they demonstrated effective neutralizing activity against CHIKV infection both in vitro and in vivo. This thereby establishes a potential preventive and therapeutic approach to combat CHIKV infection. Pathogenesis studies conducted with related alpha virus, like RRV, have shown the role of macrophages in persistence on infection [48] . They also demonstrated the role of RRV-specific CD8 T cells in clearing viral load in infected patients, thereby warranting similar investigations with CHIKV and the importance of investigating a cell-mediated immune response-based vaccine against CHIKV [49] . There are always certain risks associated with live attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines [50] . One way to avoid these potential problems is to construct a consensus-based DNA vaccine.Question: What percentage of the patients still have the CHIKV IgM after eighteen months?","answer":"The chronic stage of CHIKF is characterized by"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Using cell-specific inducible gene recombination in mice we found that, in the postnatal inner ear, Bbnf and Ntf3 are required for the formation and maintenance of hair cell ribbon synapses in the vestibular and cochlear epithelia, respectively. We also show that supporting cells in these epithelia are the key endogenous source of the neurotrophins. Using a new hair cell CreERT line with mosaic expression, we also found that Ntf3's effect on cochlear synaptogenesis is highly localized. Moreover, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bbnf, promoted recovery of cochlear function and ribbon synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma. These results indicate that glial-derived neurotrophins play critical roles in inner ear synapse density and synaptic regeneration after injury.Introduction:The trophic factors, neurotrophin-3( Ntf3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor( Bbnf) play critical roles in the embryonic inner ear, contributing to the survival of cochlear and vestibular sensory neurons and to the establishment of their projections into the respective sensory epithelia( Fritzsch et al., 2004; Ramekers et al., 2012). Both Bdnf and Ntf3 continue to be expressed in inner ear sensory epithelia after birth. In the postnatal vestibular epithelia, Bdnf is expressed only by supporting cells( Schecterson and Bothwell, 1994; Montcouquiol et al., 1998), whereas Ntf3 is expressed by both supporting cells and hair cells( Farinas et al., 1994). In the postnatal organ of Corti, Bdnf is expressed by both inner( IHCs) and outer hair cells( OHCs) and supporting cells at early postnatal ages( P1–P6), but is only detected in supporting cells from P10 onwards( Wiechers et al., 1999). All cells in the early postnatal organ of Corti appear to express Ntf3, but in the adult, expression is restricted to the IHCs and their surrounding supporting cells, with higher levels in the apical( low-frequency) region than at the base of the cochlear spiral( Sugawara et al., 2007). Thus Bdnf and Ntf3 could have significant functions in the postnatal inner ear, and alterations in expression of these neurotrophins may modulate structure and function in the adult inner ear. In this study, we investigated the roles of postnatal Ntf3 and Bdnf in both normal and damaged inner ears. Using cell-specific and inducible knockout or overexpression technology, we eliminated or increased neurotrophin expression from supporting cells or hair cells in the postnatal inner ear. We show that these neurotrophins, when expressed by the glia-like supporting cells in these sensory epithelia, are required for the formation and/or maintenance of ribbon synapses, a role distinct from the one they play in embryogenesis. Ntf3 has major effects only in the cochlea, while postnatal Bdnf appears to act only in the vestibular organs. Furthermore, we show that Ntf3 overexpression can elicit regeneration of the synaptic contacts between cochlear nerve terminals and inner hair cells after noise-induced synaptopathy, a type of neural damage which appears to be widespread even in ears exposed at sound levels well below those which cause hair cell damage and permanent threshold shifts( Kujawa and Liberman, 2009).Discussion:Neurotrophins are key molecular mediators for synaptic development and function in the central nervous system( Gomez-Palacio-Schjetnan and Escobar, 2013). In this study, we show that Ntf3 and Bdnf, which are necessary for sensory neuron survival in the developing inner ear( Fritzsch et al., 2004; Ramekers et al., 2012), continue to play important and complementary roles in the postnatal inner ear, specifically by modulating the number of synapses between hair cells and sensory neurons. Our results indicate that supporting cells of the sensory epithelia are the key source of these neurotrophins in the postnatal inner ear. Importantly, we show that increasing the availability of Ntf3, but not Bdnf, promotes the recovery of both cochlear responses and IHC synapses after acoustic trauma, even when Ntf3 expression is induced after noise exposure. The specificity of the effects of each neurotrophin on each organ cannot be explained simply by the spatio-temporal expression pattern of the components for these signaling pathways, as both Bdnf and Ntf3, as well as their respective receptors Ntrk2( TrkB) and Ntrk3( TrkC), are expressed in the postnatal and adult cochlea and vestibular organs( Pirvola et al., 1992; Fritzsch et al., 1999; Gestwa et al., 1999; Wiechers et al., 1999; Farinas et al., 2001; Stankovic and Corfas, 2003; Sugawara et al., 2007). A similar specificity in the biological roles of these neurotrophins has been shown in embryonic development, that is, constitutive knockout of Bdnf or Ntf3 reveals predominant pro-survival roles on vestibular or cochlear neurons, respectively( Farinas et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1994; Ernfors et al., 1995; Schimmang et al., 1995; Bianchi et al., 1996). However, while genetic replacement of one neurotrophin with the other can almost completely rescue neuronal survival deficits caused by constitutive deletion of either Bdnf or Ntf3( Coppola et al., 2001; Agerman et al., 2003), we observed that Ntf3 and Bdnf have distinct and non-overlapping roles in postnatal synapse formation. Thus, it appears that vestibular and auditory primary sensory neurons can respond equally to endogenous levels of either Bdnf or Ntf3 during development, but this ability is lost after birth. In the vestibular system, supporting cell-derived Bdnf is the sole neurotrophin necessary for postnatal formation and maintenance of hair cell synapses( Gomez-Casati et al., 2010b), and the levels of Bdnf expressed by these non-neuronal cells is not limiting, as Bdnf overexpression does not alter vestibular function. While previous studies of constitutive knockouts showed that Ntf3 is necessary for the survival of a subpopulation of vestibular neurons during embryogenesis( Ernfors et al., 1995), our data indicate that Ntf3, which like Bdnf is expressed primarily by supporting cells in the postnatal vestibular sensory epithelia( Sugawara et al., 2007), is dispensable in the vestibular system after birth. In contrast to the vestibular organs, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bdnf, is necessary for the establishment of normal synapses and auditory function in the cochlear base. The correlation of Ntf3 expression levels with synapse numbers and cochlear sensitivity in both knockout and overexpression models indicates that supporting cell-derived Ntf3 is not only a critical but also a limiting factor in the postnatal cochlea. Interestingly, postnatal knockout of supporting cell-derived Ntf3 and Bdnf did not affect the survival of the sensory neurons themselves, in either the vestibular( Gomez-Casati et al., 2010b) or the cochlear( spiral) ganglion, indicating that endogenous Ntf3 and Bdnf become dispensable for neuronal survival after birth. These sensory neurons may become independent of trophic support in the adult, or alternatively, other trophic factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1( Igf1) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor( Mif), may promote survival after birth. Both Igf1 and Mif are expressed in the postnatal cochlea, and, for both, loss results in ganglion cell death or altered innervation after birth( Camarero et al., 2001; Bank et al., 2012). In addition, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor( Gdnf) is also expressed in postnatal inner ear( Stankovic and Corfas, 2003), and it has been suggested that vestibular neurons switch trophic sensitivity from Bdnf to Gdnf after target innervation( Hashino et al., 1999). Although adult inner hair cells also express Ntf3( Wheeler et al., 1994; Sugawara et al., 2007), we found no cochlear dysfunction in mice lacking Ntf3 expression in these cells. The lack of phenotype in the hair cell-specific Ntf3 knockout is unlikely due to the partial recombination in hair cells because( a) recombination in supporting cells and IHCs had similar efficiency( ∼60%);( b) cochlear Ntf3 expression was reduced to a similar extent by deletion from either supporting cells or hair cells; and( c) Ntf3 overexpression by hair cells had similar effects on cochlear function and synapse density as that seen in Ntf3 overexpression by supporting cells, indicating that modulation of Ntf3 expression in a subset of hair cells is sufficient to produce phenotypic outcomes. These observations support the conclusion that endogenous Ntf3 expressed by postnatal supporting cells, but not inner hair cells, is necessary for normal cochlear function. The mosaic recombination pattern in the Pou4f3/CreERT Ntf3 overexpression revealed that the effects of Ntf3 on hair cell synaptogenesis are precisely localized, that is, synapse density was increased only on hair cells in which the transgene was activated. Thus, it appears that supporting cells create a physical barrier, allowing for local signaling events without cross talk between adjacent hair cells. The lack of effect of postnatal Ntf3 knockout or overexpression on the total number of myelinated sensory axons in the osseous spiral lamina indicates that the changes in synapses is not due to alterations in the number of sensory neurons, and thus it is consistent with the notion that the effects of Ntf3 are local. Present results suggest that Ntf3 levels may regulate the number of synapses by influencing branching of the unmyelinated terminals of cochlear sensory neurons. Regardless of the cellular origin, the effects of Ntf3 knockout or overexpression on synaptic density and cochlear function are restricted to the high-frequency( basal) half of the cochlea. The pro-survival effects of embryonic Ntf3 have the same tonotopy, that is, the loss of spiral ganglion cells in mice with Ntf3 or Ntrk3 knockout are primarily seen at the cochlear base( Fritzsch et al., 1997; Tessarollo et al., 1997; Coppola et al., 2001; Farinas et al., 2001). Thus, it appears that Ntf3 is the key endogenous trophic factor for both embryonic development and postnatal function of high-frequency cochlear neurons. A previous study showed that Ntf3 promotes axonal growth and synaptogenesis in organ of Corti explants after excitotoxicity( Wang and Green, 2011). Our results indicate that in vivo, Ntf3 regulates ribbon synapse numbers without altering cochlear nerve axonal numbers, suggesting a direct effect of Ntf3 on IHC synaptogenesis. Most importantly, overexpression of Ntf3, but not Bdnf, promotes recovery from noise-induced synaptic degeneration and the associated decrements in auditory evoked potentials. Since the Ntf3 receptor Ntrk3 is expressed by cochlear neurons, not IHCs( Gestwa et al., 1999), our results suggest that Ntf3 overexpression acts first by promoting the recovery of post-synaptic terminals, which prevents the progressive loss of pre-synaptic ribbons, and enhances the regeneration of IHC synapses after noise exposure. There has been extensive exploration of the use of Bdnf and Ntf3 as therapeutics for sensorineural hearing loss, based on their pro-survival effects on spiral ganglion neurons after hair cell degeneration due to ototoxic drugs( Ramekers et al., 2012). It has been suggested that these neurotrophins might promote long-term neuronal survival in cochlear implant users, who typically have few, if any, remaining hair cells( Budenz et al., 2012). Recent studies in mice have shown that significant synaptic loss precedes hair cell death and spiral ganglion cell degeneration in both noise-induced and age-related hearing loss( Kujawa and Liberman, 2009; Sergeyenko et al., 2013), and it has been suggested that this primary neuropathy is a major cause of problems hearing in a noisy environment, the most common complaint of those with sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, treatment of cochlear synaptopathy presents a novel therapeutic approach for age-related and noise-induced hearing loss. While a number of trophic factors, including Bdnf and Ntf3, can mediate the survival of injured sensory neurons( Roehm and Hansen, 2005; Ramekers et al., 2012), our findings indicate that specific neurotrophins are required to promote regeneration and to regain function of the synaptic connections in damaged inner ear epithelia.","answer":"Noise-induced hearing loss is common , and can result from prolonged exposure to moderate levels of noise that are not perceived as painful or even unpleasant .

When sound waves hit the cochlea , they cause the fluid inside it to vibrate: the hair cells detect these vibrations and convert them into electrical signals that are sent along neurons to the brain . However , vibrations that are too strong can destroy hair cells . Increasing evidence suggests that hearing loss also results from damage to the synapses that connect the hair cells and the neurons in the cochlea . During development of the inner ear , molecules called growth factors are needed to ensure the survival of these neurons . Wan et al . predicted that these growth factors might also have a role in adult animals , and that producing more of them might help to safeguard hearing from the damaging effects of noise . Consistent with this , mice that were genetically modified to lack a growth factor called neurotrophin-3 had cochleae that did not work properly and had fewer synapses between hair cells and neurons compared to control mice . Conversely , mice that produced too much neurotrophin-3 had more synapses than controls and also recovered more quickly from the effects of 2 hr exposure to 100 dB noise ( roughly the volume of a pneumatic drill ) . Studies of the cochlea revealed that the extra neurotrophin-3 had boosted the regeneration of synapses damaged by the noise . The beneficial effects of neurotrophin-3 were still seen when overproduction was started shortly after noise exposure , suggesting that it could have therapeutic potential . This is particularly significant in the light of recent evidence that the loss of synapses often comes before the death of hair cells in both age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

METHODS From May 2003 to June 2006 , 60 patients with palmar hyperhidrosis were prospect ively r and omized for video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy at the T2 or T3 ganglion level . They were followed for a mean of 20 months and were evaluated regarding their degree of improvement of palmar hyperhidrosis , incidence and severity of compensatory hyperhidrosis and its evolution over time , and quality of life . RESULTS Fifty-nine cases presented resolution of the palmar hyperhidrosis . One case of therapeutic failure occurred in the T3 group . Most of the patients presented an improvement in palmar hyperhidrosis , without any difference between the groups . Twenty months later , all patients in both groups presented some degree of compensatory hyperhidrosis but with less severity in the T3 group ( p = 0.007 ) . Compensatory hyperhidrosis developed in most patients during the first month after the operation , with incidence and severity that remained stable over time . An improvement in quality of life was seen starting from the first postoperative evaluation but without any difference between the groups . This improvement was maintained until the end of the follow-up . CONCLUSION Both techniques were effective for treating palmar hyperhidrosis . The most frequent complication was compensatory hyperhidrosis , which presented stable incidence and severity over the study period . Sympathectomy at the T3 level presented compensatory hyperhidrosis with less severity . Nevertheless , the improvement in quality of life was similar between the groupsTitle 2:T3/T4 thoracic sympathictomy and compensatory sweating in treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis.Abstract 2:BACKGROUND Compensatory sweating ( CS ) is one of the most common postoperative complications after thoracic sympathectomy , sympathicotomy or endoscopic sympathetic block ( ESB ) for palmar hyperhidrosis . This study was conducted to examine the relevance between CS and the sympathetic segment being transected in the surgical treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis , and thus to detect the potential mechanism of the occurrence of CS . METHODS Between October 2004 and June 2006 , 163 patients with primary hyperhidrosis were r and omly divided into two groups , T(3 ) sympathicotomy ( 78 patients ) and T(4 ) sympathicotomy ( 85 ) , who were operated upon under general anesthesia via single lumen intubation and intercostal video-mediastinoscopy ( VM ) . RESULTS No morbidity or mortality occurred . Palmar hyperhidrosis was cured in all patients . Follow-up ( mean ( 13.8 + /- 6.2 ) months ) showed no recurrence of palmar hyperhidrosis . The difference of rates of mild CS in groups T(3 ) and T(4 ) was of no statistical significance . The rate of moderate CS was significantly lower in group T(4 ) than in group T(3 ) . No severe CS occurred . CONCLUSION The rates of occurrence and severity of CS are lowered with the lower sympathetic chain being transectedTitle 3:Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for palmar hyperhidrosis: a randomized control trial comparing T3 and T2-4 ablation.Abstract 3:BACKGROUND Compensatory sweating is a major and troublesome complication noted frequently after sympathectomy in patients with primary palmar hyperhidrosis . This r and omized clinical trial was projected to measure the impact of limited denervation on compensatory sweating while performing endoscopic thoracic sympthectomy . METHODS Two hundred thirty-two patients with primary palmar hyperhidrosis were r and omly allocated to either a T3 sympathectomy treatment , called group T3 , or a T2 - 4 sympathetic treatment , called group T2 - 4 . The patients underwent bilateral sympathetic ablation at corresponding levels . All patients were followed up and evaluated for comparison of symptom resolution , postoperative complication , levels of satisfaction , and severity of compensatory sweating between the two groups . RESULTS Sex , age , family history , and distribution of sweating were similar in both groups . The postoperative complications were minor , and Horner 's syndrome was not detected in either group . The frequency of mild and moderate compensatory sweating was not significantly different between the two groups , but the incidence of severe compensatory sweating was significantly lower after T3 sympathectomy ( 3 % versus 10 % ) . As for satisfaction rate , group T3 was superior to group T2 - 4 ( 96.6 % versus 89.6 % ) . The rate of symptom resolution was 100 % , and no recurrence was found in either group . CONCLUSIONS The single-level sympathetic denervation under thoracoscopy is a safe and effective procedure to treat primary palmar hyperhidrosis . This method reduces the incidence of severe compensatory sweating postoperatively without compromising the patient 's satisfactionTitle 4:Quantification of eccrine sweat glands with acetylcholine sweat-spot test and anatomical redistribution of sweating after T2–T3 thoracoscopic sympathicolysisAbstract 4:Background In this study , patients treated by thoracoscopic sympathicolysis for palmar hyperhidrosis were evaluated to determine the number and response of sweat gl and s to intradermal acetylcholine stimulus . Methods A total of 30 patients were included in the study . Group A consisted of 10 patients with palmar hyperhidrosis who underwent thoracoscopic sympathicolysis in October 2005 , and group B consisted of 20 patients who underwent surgery during the years 1999 , 2000 , and 2001 . The study procedure involved applying iodine alcohol to the palm and then intradermally injecting 0.1 ml 1 % acetylcholine . This activated the sweat gl and s , which were then photographed and counted . The study procedure was performed prospect ively over different periods in group A and retrospectively in group B. Results In group A , the mean number of gl and s activated 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after surgery were 41 , 174.20 , 522.8 , and 747.2 , respectively ; this gradual increase was statistically significant over the first 6 months ( p = 0.004 ) but not between months 6 and 12 ( p = 0.255 ) . The trend towards an increasing number of active gl and s occurred in both groups , with a mean of 1369.8 active gl and s in group B compared to 747.2 ( p = 0.095 ) in group A after 12 months . Conclusion It is well-known that Cannon ’s law of denervation ( 1939 ) is not applicable to the sweat gl and s , that is , there is no hyperactivation following intradermal acetylcholine stimulation . However , some response , which increased over the first 6 months following surgery , was observed in our study . Nevertheless , this activation is subsequently self-limiting , result ing in no gl and atrophy , and reinnervation occurs without patient awarenessTitle 5:Objective evaluation of patients with palmar hyperhidrosis submitted to two levels of sympathectomy: T3 and T4.Abstract 5:This study compares the results obtained of video-assisted sympathectomy performed on two distinct ganglion levels ( third vs. fourth thoracic ganglion ) in the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis ( PH ) , through a blind r and omized clinical trial . All participants were r and omized into two groups of 20 patients ( G3 and G4 ) and underwent the operation , and were followed for 12 months . We used an objective method for measuring sweat , checking the transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) , and evaluated the quality -of-life ( QoL ) before and after the operation . All patients ( n=40 ) ceased suffering from PH after surgery , with statistical difference when we compared the values of TEWL palmar preoperatively with their respective values at one week , one month , six months and 12 months . The main side effect observed was compensatory hyperhidrosis ( CH ) , which was most frequent in G3 after 12 months of follow-up . There was an improvement in QoL since the first evaluation of the postoperative period with no difference between groups . Both techniques were effective in the treatment of PH , generating objective reduction of TEWL regardless of the ganglion operated . Sympathectomy G3 had a higher incidence of CH , yet the improvement in QoL was similar in both groupsTitle 6:Thoracoscopic sympathicotomy for disabling palmar hyperhidrosis: a prospective randomized comparison between two levels.Abstract 6:BACKGROUND Thoracoscopic sympathicotomy is highly effective in treating disabling palmar hyperhidrosis . The ideal level to maximize efficacy and minimize the side effect of compensatory hyperhidrosis ( CH ) is controversial . This study compared sympathicotomy over the second ( R2 ) vs third ( R3 ) costal head relative to these variables in patients with massive palmar hyperhidrosis . METHODS This prospect i ve , r and omized study enrolled 121 patients with disabling palmoplantar hyperhidrosis assigned to bilateral sympathicotomy ( sympathetic transection ) , which was done over R2 in 61 ( n = 122 extremities ) or R3 in 60 ( n = 120 extremities ) . Patients were question ed at 6 months and at 1 year or more to assess efficacy , side effects , and satisfaction with the procedure . RESULTS Sympathicotomy at R2 failed to cure palmar hyperhidrosis in 5 of 122 ( 4.1 % ) extremities , but only 2 ( 1.6 % ) were to a truly profound dripping level of recurrence .  Sympathicotomy at R3 failed to cure palmar hyperhidrosis in 5 of 120 extremities ( 4.2 % ) , and all were dramatic failures with dripping recurrent sweating . The patients whose palmar hyperhidrosis was not completely cured were aged 19.7 ± 2.5 vs 26.4 ± 8.0 years ( p = 0.04 ) . Two R3 patients with failure underwent three redo R2 sympathicotomies , with curative results . R2 patients showed a trend toward a higher level of CH vs R3 patients at 6 months and after 1 year . The CH severity scale was 4.7 ± 2.7 ( n = 38 ) for R2 vs 3.8 ± 2.8 ( n = 36 ) for R3 ( p = NS ) at 6 months and 4.7 ± 2.5 ( n = 43 ) for R2 vs 3.7 ± 2.8 ( n = 37 ) for R3 ( p = NS ) after 1 year . Younger age , male sex , and higher levels of preoperative and postoperative plantar sweating were predictors of failed sympathicotomy . Increased age was associated with increased CH . CONCLUSIONS R2 and R3 sympathicotomy for massive palmoplantar hyperhidrosis are highly effective , with low recurrence and incidences of severe CH . R2 tends to have a higher level of CH vs R3 , and a higher incidence of dramatic failures is suggested in R3 patients , for which reoperation at the R2 level will likely be curativeTitle 7:Surgical treatment of primary palmar hyperhidrosis: a prospective randomized study comparing T3 and T4 sympathicotomy.Abstract 7:OBJECTIVE Endoscopic thoracic sympathetic surgery was effective for palmar hyperhidrosis ( PH ) , but side effects such as compensatory sweating and over dry h and s were common . A multiple centers prospect i ve r and omized study was design ed to compare the efficiency and side effects of T3 and T4 sympathicotomy in the treatment of PH . METHODS From September 2004 to February 2006 , 141 consecutive patients with PH were r and omized into two therapeutic groups : group T3 underwent T3 sympathicotomy ( n=68 ) and group T4 underwent T4 sympathicotomy ( n=73 ) . Improvement of h and sweating , side effects like compensatory sweating or over dry h and s , and satisfactory rate of the patients were recorded . RESULTS There were 78 males and 63 females . The median age was 26.9 years . The two groups were comparable in gender , age , severity of sweating and average period of follow-up . All operations were successful with no severe complications or perioperative mortality . A 17.8+/-7.9 month follow-up showed that palmar sweating improved in all patients and the effective rate was 100 % . Mild moist h and s occurred more frequent in group T4 than in group T3 ( 59.4 % vs 25.8 % , p<0.0001 ) . Most involved patients were ' very satisfied ' with this result except for four patients ( 5.8 % ) in group T4 ; incidences of compensatory sweating and over dry h and s were both lower in group T4 than in group T3 ( 56.5 % vs 77.4 % , p=0.011 and 1.4 % vs 12.9 % , p=0.013 , respectively ) . Moderate compensatory sweating ( CS ) occurred in 14.5 % in group T3 and 2.9 % in group T4 ( p=0.017 ) . ' Very satisfied ' rate was higher in group T4 than in group T3 ( p<0.0001 ) while ' partially satisfied ' rate was comparable between the two groups . CONCLUSION T3 and T4 sympathicotomies are both effective for the treatment of PH . T4 sympathicotomy , decreases the side effects but do not compromise the therapeutic effects , and should be the method of choice","answer":"No significant differences were found in symptom resolution and recurrence .T4 TS appears to be more useful than T3 or T2 TS for PH"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

While most AMPs act by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane, specific subclasses of AMPs have been identified that pass through membranes and inhibit bacterial growth by targeting fundamental intracellular processes. One such subclass is the proline -rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) that bind to the ribosome and interfere with the process of protein synthesis. A diverse range of PrAMPs have been identified in insects, such as bees, wasps and beetles, and crustaceans, such as crabs, as well as in mammals, such as cows, sheep, goats and pigs. Mechanistically, the best-characterized PrAMPs are the insect oncocins, such as Onc112, and bovine bactenecins, such as Bac7. Biochemical and structural studies have revealed that these PrAMPs bind within the ribosomal exit tunnel with a reverse orientation compared to a nascent polypeptide chain. The PrAMPs allow initiation but prevent the transition into the elongation phase of translation. Insight into the interactions of PrAMPs with their ribosomal target provides the opportunity to further develop these peptides as novel antimicrobial agents.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"membranes\\", \\"membrane\\", \\"ribosome\\", \\"ribosomal\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"bacterial\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"initiation\\", \\"protein synthesis\\", \\"translation\\", \\"elongation\\", \\"intracellular processes\\", \\"growth\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [\\"innate immune system\\"], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"peptides\\", \\"proline\\", \\"oncocins\\", \\"Bac7\\", \\"antimicrobial agents\\", \\"polypeptide chain\\", \\"Proline\\", \\"antimicrobial peptides\\", \\"AMPs\\", \\"Onc112\\", \\"bactenecins\\", \\"PrAMPs\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"crustaceans\\", \\"beetles\\", \\"bovine\\", \\"pigs\\", \\"goats\\", \\"insects\\", \\"insect\\", \\"crabs\\", \\"wasps\\", \\"cows\\", \\"bees\\", \\"sheep\\", \\"mammals\\"], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"subclasses\\", \\"subclass\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"array\\", \\"orientation\\", \\"further\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

cooked foods .moreover , the influence on furan levels of other practices commonly applied after the pressure cooking , such as an additional cooking without the lid and reheating after cold storage , was also investigated .furan and [ h4 ] furan ( furan - d4 ) were obtained from sigma - aldrich ( sigma - aldrich corp . , st .methanol was of hplc - grade ( tedia company inc . , fairfield , oh , usa ) and water was purified by reverse osmosis ( gehaka , so paulo , sp , brazil ) .individual stock solutions of both standards at ca 2  mg / ml were prepared by dissolving in methanol .intermediate and work solutions at ca 20  g / ml and 0.2  g / ml , respectively , were prepared in water .several foods were considered in the present study , including beans , soy beans , whole rice , beef , pork , potato , and cassava .the samples were obtained from the local market . with exception of beans , soy beans , and whole rice ,the samples were cut in cubs of approximately 2  2  cm prior to cooking .potato and cassava were previously peeled .   a domestic aluminium pressure cooker of 4.5 litres ( clock , panex ltda , so bernardo do campo , sp , brazil ) was used in the experiments .after the addition of 400  g of the fresh sample ( prepared as mentioned above ) and 1.5  l of water at room temperature , the cooker was immediately closed and the cooking was performed during 20  min after the first release of steam from the pressure valve .the samples were cooked and reheated directly in the water in order to reproduce the domestic preparation of soups and stews .   before opening , the pressure cooker was cooled under tap water for sufficient time to eliminate the pressure .then , a portion of the cooked sample was collected as quickly as possible and properly stored until homogenization and analysis .the first one was kept in the pressure cooker and was cooked for additional 10  min without the lid .the second portion was stored under refrigeration during 24 hours and reheated in an open saucepan during 5  min after boiling .all samples were stored at 4c for at least 4 hours before homogenization in order to avoid furan loss by volatilization .the furan content was determined in the fresh , cooked , refrigerated , and reheated samples by using an in - house validated method based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry preceded by headspace solid phase microextraction ( hs - spme - gc / ms ) according to arisseto et al . .briefly , a portion of 1  g of homogeneous sample was weighed in a chilled 40  ml screw - cap glass vial fitted with silicone - ptfe septum containing a 15  mm  5  mm ptfe - coated stir bar .aliquots of 125  l of furan - d4 working standard solution 0.2  g / ml and 875  l of water were added and the vial was immediately closed .the spme was carried out in a 75  m carboxen - polydimethylsiloxane ( car - pdms ) fiber ( supelco , bellefonte , pa , usa ) at 25c during 30  min , under a constant magnetic agitation rate of 1200  rpm , approximately .the analyses were performed on an hp 6890 gas chromatography equipped with an msd 5973 mass spectrometer ( agilent technologies , palo alto , ca , usa ) .helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 0.7  ml / min .the programmable temperature vaporizing ( ptv ) injector was operated in the splitless mode under the following temperature program : 40c ( held for 0.1  min ) , 700c / min up to 230c ( held for 23  min ) .the separation was performed on a 60  m  0.25  mm , df 0.25  m hp - innowax capillary column ( agilent technologies ) and the oven temperature program was 30c ( held for 0.1  min ) , 2c / min up to 40c ( held for 3  min ) , and 12c / min up to 200c ( held for 2  min ) . the mass spectrometer was operated in a positive electron impact ionization mode ( + ei ) with 70  ev of the electron energy .the selected ion monitoring ( sim ) was used for the detection of furan and furan - d4 , using m / z 68/39/69 for furan and m / z 72/42 for furan - d4 ( quantifier ions ) .a dwell time of 100  ms was used for all the ions . the relative retention time ( rrt ) andfor confirmatory purposes , an acceptable deviation of 0.5% for rrt , 10% for ionic relative abundance considering m / z 39/68 , and 50% for ionic relative abundance considering m / z 69/68 were used by comparing the sample with a standard solution .the quantification of furan was carried out by extrapolation from a linear analytical curve , using the quantifier ions m / z 68 ( furan ) and m / z 72 ( furan - d4 , internal standard ) .although several studies have been published on furan levels in commercial products , few data is available for home - cooked foods .evaluated the formation of furan during domestic cooking such as grilling , roasting , baking , frying , and cooking in saucepan and microwave .however , the presence of furan in home - cooked foods prepared in a pressure cooker has not been investigated so far . figure 1 illustrates a typical ion chromatogram of a pressure - cooked pork sample and the levels of furan obtained for the pressure - cooked foods selected in the present study are shown in table 1 .the results also indicate that the pressure cooking did not produce quantifiable levels of the contaminant for any of the evaluated samples .several furan derivatives were already identified in pressure - cooked meats . in a study on volatile constituents of pressure - cooked pork liver isolated by simultaneous steam distillation and continuous solvent extraction , mussinan and walradt   identified 23 furanic compounds .other authors found out 3 furan derivatives between the most potent aromatic constituents of pressure - cooked hen meat .however , the presence of the unsubstituted compound has not been reported in these studies , which is consistent with the results obtained in the present work .nevertheless , taking into account that the formation of furan has already been demonstrated in model systems and retail foods heated in sealed vials under pressure cooking conditions , it could be suggested that any furan possibly formed in the studied samples was lost with the steam that is released by the valve when a determined pressure is reached .this is in accordance with the observations reported by hasnip et al .   that dried vegetables heated in open vials accumulated very little furan in comparison with sealed samples .it should be noted that the possible release of furan to the air kitchen during the pressure cooking could contribute for an occupational exposure to the contaminant .this should be further investigated since it has already been demonstrated that furan was found in the air kitchen as a result of some procedures , such as the addition of water to a cafetiere , the frying of chipped potatoes in an open chip pan , and baking some foods in an oven . it can be seen that no furan has also been found in quantifiable amounts in the samples cooked for additional 10  min without the lid as well as in the reheated samples after 24 hours under cold storage .data available in the literature on the furan content after the application of common warming procedures have shown conflicting results .some authors reported furan losses of 2985% , whereas others have found that furan persists during normal heating practices [ 4 , 17 , 18 ] .it has also been demonstrated that furan could even be formed at levels up to 29.2  g / kg during the reheating of baby foods containing potatoes after cold storage .however , no significant furan loss or formation was observed in the samples investigated here .it was very recently reported that additional amounts of furan can be formed from potential precursors such as 2-butenal and furfural during the thermal desorption of the fiber when using spme - gc / ms .although this technique was applied in the present study , it seems that the general impact of the possible artifactual furan formation on the obtained results was negligible .furan has been reported in a variety of thermally processed foods , including canned / jarred commercial products as well as home - cooked foods obtained by grilling , roasting , baking , or frying .although the conditions of pressure cooking can lead to furan formation in model systems and retail foods heated in sealed vials , as demonstrated by several studies , it seems that this procedure as applied at a domestic level may not represent a concern in relation to the occurrence of furan in home pressure - cooked foods .this is quite important considering that , to date , the research on furan has not been successful in identifying practical and consistently effective solutions for decreasing the levels of the contaminant in foods .also , as the interventions on furan reported in the scientific literature are mostly targeted at the level of the consumer rather than industrial production methods , the identification of domestic practices that could produce foods with reduced furan levels is highly desirable .","answer":"furan is a food processing contaminant classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans .  as the occurrence of furan has been reported in a variety of foods processed in sealed containers , the objective of this work was to investigate if the contaminant can be found in home -

Omentin-1 is a novel adipokine and is associated with incident coronary artery disease . However , it remains unclear whether serum omentin-1 levels are associated with cardiac prognosis in patients with HF . Methods We measured serum omentin-1 levels at admission in 136 consecutive patients with HF , and 20 control subjects without signs of significant heart disease . We prospect ively followed patients with HF to endpoints of cardiac death or re-hospitalization for worsening HF . Results Serum omentin-1 levels were markedly lower in HF patients with cardiac events compared with to without . The patients who were in New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class IV showed significantly lower serum omentin-1 levels compared to those in class II and III , whereas serum omentin-1 levels did not correlate with serum brain natriuretic peptide levels ( r = 0.217 , P = 0.011 ) . We divided the HF patients into three groups based on the tertiles of serum omentin-1 level ( low T1 , middle T2 , and high T3 ) . Multivariate Cox hazard analysis showed that the lowest serum omentin-1 level ( T1 ) was independently associated with cardiac events after adjustment for confounding factors ( hazard ratio 5.78 , 95 % confidence interval 1.20 - 12.79 ) . We divided the HF patients into two groups according to the median serum omentin-1 levels . Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the patients with low serum omentin-1 levels had a higher risk of cardiac events compared with those with high serum omentin-1 levels ( log-rank test p < 0.001 ) . Conclusion Decreased serum omentin-1 levels were associated with a poor cardiac outcome in patients with HFTitle 2:The independent effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus on ischemic heart disease, stroke, and death: a population-based study of 13,000 men and women with 20 years of follow-up.Abstract 2:BACKGROUND Epidemiological studies have reported that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) have increased mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular diseases , independent of other risk factors . However , most of these studies have been performed in selected patient groups . The purpose of the present study was prospect ively to assess the impact of type 2 DM on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in an unselected population . METHODS A total of 13,105 subjects from the Copenhagen City Heart Study were followed up prospect ively for 20 years . Adjusted relative risks of first , incident , admission for , or death from ischemic heart disease , acute myocardial infa rct ion , or stroke , as well as total mortality in persons with type 2 DM compared with healthy controls , were estimated . RESULTS The relative risk of first , incident , and admission for myocardial infa rct ion was increased 1.5- to 4.5-fold in women and 1.5- to 2-fold in men , with a significant difference between sexes . The relative risk of first , incident , and admission for stroke was increased 2- to 6.5-fold in women and 1.5- to 2-fold in men , with a significant difference between sexes . In both women and men the relative risk of death was increased 1.5 to 2 times . CONCLUSIONS In persons with type 2 DM , the risk of having an incident myocardial infa rct ion or stroke is increased 2- to 3-fold and the risk of death is increased 2-fold , independent of other known risk factors for cardiovascular diseasesTitle 3:Effects of the long-acting human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide on plasma omentin-1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Abstract 3:OBJECTIVE Omentin is a protein expressed and secreted from visceral but not subcutaneous adipose tissue , which increases insulin sensitivity in human adipocytes . However , its pathophysiologic role in humans remains largely unknown . The objective of this study is to assess plasma omentin-1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and matched control subjects and to investigate the effects of liraglutide on plasma omentin-1 levels in patients with T2DM . PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty T2DM patients with poor glycemic control after more than 3 months of treatment with one or two OHA(s ) ( T2DM ) , and 30 matched normal glycaemic controls ( NGT ) participated in the study . The T2DM group was given an injection of liraglutide once-daily for 16 weeks . Plasma omentin-1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the relationship between plasma omentin-1 levels and metabolic parameters was also analyzed . RESULTS Plasma omentin-1 levels were lower in T2DM than in the control ( 19.3 ± 4.0 μg/L vs. 26.4 ± 6.0 μg/L , P < 0.01 ) . Plasma omentin-1 levels increased significantly in T2DM patients after treatment with liraglutide compared with pre-treatment ( 19.3 ± 4.0 μg/L vs. 21.2 ± 3 . 9 μg/L , P < 0.01 ) . In all diabetic patients , multiple regression analysis showed that FINS and HOMA-IR were independently associated with plasma omentin-1 levels . CONCLUSIONS In T2DM patients  , plasma omentin-1 levels decreased , but significantly increased after the treatment with liraglutide and metformin . These data suggest that liraglutide may play a role in increasing omentin-1 levels in T2DM patients","answer":"Conclusion We found that serum omentin level is significantly lower in T2DM and IGT patients but not in T1DM ones .These data could be used by clinicians for early diagnosis and management of diabetes ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Many etiologic factors cause a femoral head necrosis such as , for example , high-dose steroids , abuse of alcohol , defect of bone marrow and trauma of the hip . Often the X-ray photograph leads to the diagnosis in the second stage ( ARCO 1992 ) or in the third stage , when the femoral head has begun to collapse . The stage IIc and III shows an evident enhancement in contrast media in MRI . Contrast enhancement is demonstrated by STIR , FATSAT , T1-weighted and dynamic screening sequence .

Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) have recently been reported as powerful inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation in a number of cell types. Given the role of this transcription factor in the regulation of gene expression in the inflammatory response, NF-kappaB inhibitors have been suggested as potential therapeutic drugs for inflammatory diseases. We show here that DTCs inhibited both interleukin 2 (IL-2) synthesis and membrane expression of antigens which are induced during T-cell activation. This inhibition, which occurred with a parallel activation of c-Jun transactivating functions and expression, was reflected by transfection experiments at the IL-2 promoter level, and involved not only the inhibition of NF-kappaB-driven reporter activation but also that of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Accordingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) indicated that pyrrolidine DTC (PDTC) prevented NF-kappaB, and NFAT DNA-binding activity in T cells stimulated with either phorbol myristate acetate plus ionophore or antibodies against the CD3-T-cell receptor complex and simultaneously activated the binding of AP-1. Furthermore, PDTC differentially targeted both NFATp and NFATc family members, inhibiting the transactivation functions of NFATp and mRNA induction of NFATc. Strikingly, Western blotting and immunocytochemical experiments indicated that PDTC promoted a transient and rapid shuttling of NFATp and NFATc, leading to their accelerated export from the nucleus of activated T cells. We propose that the activation of an NFAT kinase by PDTC could be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the NFAT, therefore transiently converting the sustained transactivation of this transcription factor that occurs during lymphocyte activation, and show that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) can act by directly phosphorylating NFATp. In addition, the combined inhibitory effects on NFAT and NF-KB support a potential use of DTCs as immunosuppressants.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"activated T cells\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"IL - 2 promoter\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"NFATc\\", \\"NFATp and NFATc family members\\", \\"JNK\\", \\"interleukin 2\\", \\"AP - 1\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"NFATp\\", \\"this transcription factor\\", \\"NFAT\\", \\"NF - KB\\", \\"the NFAT\\", \\"c - Jun\\", \\"c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase\\", \\"antigens\\", \\"nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"nuclear factor of activated T cells\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"CD3 - T - cell receptor complex\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

MNDA (myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen) is an interferon alpha regulated nuclear protein expressed only in cells of the human myelomonocytic lineage. To identify mechanisms responsible for this lineage-specific and interferon-regulated expression, the 5' flanking sequence of the gene has been characterized. Two interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) flank a multiple transcription start site region identifying MNDA as a TATA-less interferon-regulated gene. Other DNA elements present include a cluster of Myb sites, several Ets, an Ets related PU. 1 site and an Sp1 site located within 600 bp of the transcription start sites. In addition, DNA methylation was revealed as one of the possible factors in establishing MNDA expression. The 5' flanking sequence has promoter activity which is elevated by interferon alpha. The findings indicate that MNDA expression is regulated by mechanisms similar to other myelomonocytic cell specific genes and genes up-regulated by interferon alpha.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human myelomonocytic lineage\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen gene promoter\\", \\"TATA - less interferon - regulated gene\\", \\"interferon - stimulated response elements\\", \\"Ets\\", \\"DNA elements\\", \\"Sp1 site\\", \\"Myb sites\\", \\"ISRE\\", \\"transcription start sites\\", \\"Ets related PU . 1 site\\", \\"5u0027 flanking sequence\\", \\"myelomonocytic cell specific genes\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"interferon alpha\\", \\"interferon alpha regulated nuclear protein\\", \\"MNDA\\", \\"myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVE To compare profiles and related factors of irregular bleeding induced by different types of low-dose hormone therapy ( HT ) and a Chinese formulated herbs products . METHODS Applied with open-labeled , randomized , and clinical trial design , 136 postmenopausal women were assigned into four groups : group A : estradiol valerate ( E2 V ) 1 mg/d + medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) 2 mg/d ; group B : conjugated equine estrogen 0.45 mg/d + MPA 2 mg/d ; group C : tibolone 1.25 mg/d ; group D : a Chinese formulated herbs product ( Kuntai ) 4 # tid . Each subject took element calcium 400 mg/d and vitamin D 200 IU/d concomitantly . Modified Kupperman scores were assessed on baseline and every 3 months thereafter and irregular bleeding was recorded on menopausal diary every day . The duration of this study was 1 year . Results The efficacies were similar in three HT-managed groups , but was better than in group D , although the latter was also effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms . Hazard ratio ( HR ) of irregular bleeding was 1.00 in group C , 2.43 in group A ( 95 % CI : 1.08-5.46 ) , 3.12 in group B ( 95 % CI : 1.42-6.88 ) , and 0.73 in group D ( 95 % CI : 0.26-2.04 ) . Most cases initially experienced bleeding in the first 3 months but such initiation was a bit later in group C. Endometrium , as detected by B-mode ultrasound , increased approximately 1 mm in HT groups , while it was a bit thicker in group C. Long periods in reproductive age and short time since menopause were high risk factors for irregular bleeding . CONCLUSION Profiles of irregular bleeding in 3 commonly used types of low-dose HT are different and some factors such as long period in reproductive age and short time since menopause may contribute to bleeding initiation .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"a Chinese formulated herbs product ( Kuntai )\\", \\"low-dose hormone therapy\\", \\"Chinese formulated herbs products\\", \\"conjugated equine estrogen 0.45 mg/d\\", \\"tibolone\\", \\"calcium\\", \\"low-dose HT\\", \\"MPA 2\\", \\"medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) 2 mg/d\\", \\"vitamin D\\", \\"low-dose hormone therapy ( HT )\\", \\"estradiol valerate ( E2 V ) 1 mg/d\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"initiation\\", \\"effective\\", \\"bleeding\\", \\"Endometrium\\", \\"efficacies\\", \\"irregular bleeding\\", \\"Hazard ratio ( HR ) of irregular bleeding\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"women\\", \\"postmenopausal\\", \\"136\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

making on the timing and nature of interventions on the aortic valve ( av ) or aor .transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) can easily assess the aor , and repeated measurements are safe and reliable.1,2 some guidelines have suggested that specified measurement methods could be used to improve the reliability and validity of aor measurement with tte.3,4 aortic dilatation is strongly associated with the presence and progression of aortic regurgitation,5 and with the occurrence of aortic dissection.6 just as the left atrium ( la ) volume ( which reflects long - standing hemodynamic conditions ) has been compared with the glycated hemoglobin of diabetes mellitus,7 aortic dilatation assessed by volume determination ( rather than linear dimensions ) may also have similar quantitative strengths and may perhaps better predict outcomes in aor diseases .when la size is measured in clinical practice , volume determinations are preferred over linear dimensions because they allow accurate assessment of the asymmetric remodeling of the la chamber.8 in addition , the strength of the relationship between cardiovascular diseases is stronger for la volume than for la linear dimensions.9,10 excellent correlation has been demonstrated between aor volumes measured using real - time three - dimensional echocardiography ( rt3de ) and multidetector computed tomography ( ct).11 however , rt3de analyses are time consuming , and this modality has the tendency of underestimating the aor volume .since there is , however , no existing information on the expected normal range for aor size assessed by volume determination using two - dimensional ( 2d ) echocardiography , there is a need to investigate and create a reference range of values as baseline information among the healthy normotensive population .our attempt at quantification of the aor size using 2d volume determination is therefore a logical consequence of the progress that has been made in the assessment of the dimensions of the la and left ventricle ( lv ) using volume rather than linear measurements .we hypothesized that linear measurements may be an inaccurate surrogate for volume because the use is based on the unlikely assumption that asymmetric remodeling does not occur in the aor , and therefore , there is a constant relation among aor dimensions .the objective of this study is to determine the aor by volume by 2d echocardiography using specified planes of acquisition and previously defined landmarks for measurement and establish normal ranges and their variations with respect to gender and age .in addition , we further attempted to establish the relevance of the mean aor volume obtained by comparing our results with that of two deceased patients with the established aor disease .the research procedures were approved by the osun state health research ethics committee , and the research was conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki .all studies were performed with a 3.5 mhz transducer and a toshiba nemio xg or a siemens acuson cypress .the american society of echocardiography ( ase ) recommends that in quantification of the aor , 2d , parasternal long - axis images should be used to visualize the left ventricular outflow tract ( lvot ) and the aor should be recorded in different views in varying intercostal spaces and at different distances from the left sternal border .we propose that the aor volume may be obtained using the modified simpson s method by tracing from the hinge point of the right coronary cusp of the av to the widest point of the corresponding sinus of valsalva ( sov ) , and then to the corresponding sinotubular junction ( stj ) .the tracing should then be continued across the lvot to the opposite stj , to the neighboring sov , and finally back to the hinge point of the noncoronary cusp of the av . due to movement of the aor during the cardiac cycleappendices 12 ) and end diastolic frame ( peak of r wave  appendices 34 ) most useful in demonstrating the landmarks for optimal tracing . by freeze - frame analysis ,the systolic frame was scrolled to the widest excursion of the aortic leaflets , just before valve closure .we calculated the aor volume using the modified simpson s method ( biplane method of disks ) .we thereafter compared the normotensive individuals in our cohort with the two isolated cases of known aortic disease .the subjects comprised three age groups , namely , 1844 , 4564 , and 6579 years .normal aor measurement ( volume and linear ) ranges and their variations with respect to gender and age were observed .the mean aor volume was 6.84  1.96 ml in diastole and 8.32  2.20 ml in systole .both 1844 years and 4564 years age groups had comparable average diastolic ( 6.8  2.1 vs 6.8  1.1 and 7.8  1.0 ; f = 0.343 , p = 0.711 ) and systolic ( 8.2  2.3 vs 8.3  1.4 and 10.7  0.6 ; f = 1.866 , p = 0.166 ) volume measurements ; however , a sharp increase was observed in the oldest age group , and there was no statistically significant difference in all the measurements though .these results were further presented in figures 1 and 2 . in aor volumes , in table 2 , diastole and systolewere typically found to be significantly larger in males than in females ( 7.8  1.9 ml ) vs ( 5.5  1.1 ml ) and ( 9.3  2.1 ml ) vs ( 6.9  1.5 ml ) , respectively , p < 0.0001 in each case . in table 3 , the mean aor volume in diastole and systole for the normotensive individuals aged 65 years and above is 7.8  1.0 ml and 10.7  0.6 ml , respectively .conversely , we found that the aor volume of a 73-year - old hypertensive male who suffered aortic dissection was 38.6 ml , which is about five times larger compared with our mean volume in diastole .the corresponding lvot and sov measurements of the patient with the dissection were 3.1 and 4.8 cm , respectively ( appendices 56 ) .the mean lvot , sov , and stj measurements in our male sample aged 65 and above were 1.8  0.1 cm , 3.0  0.2 cm , and 2.5  0.2 cm , respectively .we also compared our mean aor volume with that of a 12-year - old boy diagnosed with marfan s syndrome .he was found to have an appreciably larger aor volume of 18.4 ml ( appendix 7 ) .the corresponding lvot , sov , and stj measurements for this boy were 1.9 , 3.5 , and 2.7 cm , respectively .rt3de is a useful imaging modality that can be easily performed in the clinical practice and has been proven to be applicable in measuring the real volumes of cardiac chambers such as the lv,1214 la,15,16 and the right ventricle,17 without geometric assumption .the volumes measured using rt3de are well correlated with volumes assessed using other imaging tools such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and multidetector ct .however , analysis of rt3de is time consuming among other challenges of this modality18 and may not be easily adaptable for routine clinical use .we found that it took less than three additional minutes to measure the aor volume by tracing , as described earlier .though the authors of previous studies did not present the time required for image analysis , 2030 minutes would be necessary to analyze one image acquired by rt3de .we found that the aor volume was larger in systole compared with diastole by about 2.0 ml .this is likely due to the deformations of the aor during a cardiac cycle.1922 these deformations allow for aor expansion during isovolumic contraction .these deformations in the aor may also explain our observation that visualization of the stj was much more challenging at the end systole .therefore , this emphasizes the need for the location and timing of measurements to be well defined , as outlined earlier for reproducibility of results .aor dimensions were typically found to be larger by about 2 ml in males than in females . comparing those aged 1844 years with those aged 4564 years , volumes increased by 0.1 ml , and it increased by about 12 ml in 65-year olds or older .our finding is in keeping with other studies conducted using cardiovascular mri , which have found that the aor dimensions are larger in males compared with females and that dimensions increase with age.22 we made a brief attempt to establish the relevance of volume measurements by comparing this new variable with the established linear dimensions of two clearly diseased aortas .we found that the aor volume of a 73-year - old male patient who died from aortic dissection is five times the mean of the normotensive male in the same age group .the corres ponding linear dimensions were only about 1.5 times larger than the normal size .furthermore , we found that the volume of the aor of a 12-year - old boy suffering from marfan s syndrome had doubled compared with our mean volume .the implication of the results of these comparisons is that volume measurements show remarkable deviations in aor between the normal and the diseased individuals , whereas a linear measurement does not .this then suggests that a earlier prompt for intervention is more likely if deviations from the normal aor dimension is based on volume measurements rather than the linear measurements , which could be less sensitive as was observed .several studies have shown that a substantial number of complications occurred in patients with aor dimensions less than that for which prophylactic root replacement is routinely performed.2326 until a molecular - based approach is widely available that will identify patients at high cardiovascular risk , echocardiographic variables will remain the most important prognostic indicators.23 therefore , we propose that assessing the aor using volume measurements , rather than linear measurements , may better quantify the severity of dilatation , enhance earlier intervention , and possibly reduce morbidity and prevent mortality in patients suffering from aor disease .this method of assessment , if adequately explored , may also have the potential of guiding therapy in aor surgery .to the best of our knowledge , our study is the first to describe aor volume measurement and present the normal range by 2d echocardiography .this novel application can represent a reproducible new way to reliably determine aor size and perhaps better quantify the degree of dilation in subjects with cardiovascular diseases with a view to predicting outcomes .we have shown an appreciable difference between the mean aor volume of our subjects and the mean aor volume of two diseased aortas .this method of volume acquisition has the potential of removing the need to routinely perform rt3de , which requires extensive training and acquisition time .","answer":"backgroundaortic dilatation is associated with the presence of aortic diseases .  current guidelines for assessing the aortic root ( aor ) depend on linear measurements acquired by two -

AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with sitagliptin, a highly selective once-daily oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control [ glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA (1c)) > or=7.5% and < or=10.5% ] while on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin. METHODS: After a screening, diet/exercise run-in and drug wash-off period, a glimepiride + /- metformin dose titration/stabilization period and a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 441 patients (of ages 18-75 years) were randomized to receive the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo in a 1: 1 ratio for 24 weeks. Of these patients, 212 were on glimepiride (> or=4 mg/day) monotherapy and 229 were on glimepiride (> or=4 mg/day) plus metformin (> or=1,500 mg/day) combination therapy. Patients exceeding pre-specified glycaemic thresholds during the double-blind treatment period were provided open-label rescue therapy (pioglitazone) until study end. The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in HbA (1c) from baseline to Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h post-meal glucose and lipid measurements. RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA (1c) was 8.34% in the sitagliptin and placebo groups. After 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduced HbA (1c) by 0.74% (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. In the subset of patients on glimepiride plus metformin, sitagliptin reduced HbA (1c) by 0.89% relative to placebo, compared with a reduction of 0.57% in the subset of patients on glimepiride alone. The addition of sitagliptin reduced FPG by 20.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and increased homeostasis model assessment-beta, a marker of beta-cell function, by 12% (p < 0.05) relative to placebo. In patients who underwent a meal tolerance test (n = 134), sitagliptin decreased 2-h post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 36.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher incidence of overall (60 vs. 47%) and drug-related adverse experiences (AEs) (15 vs. 7%) in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. This was largely because of a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs (12 vs. 2%, respectively) in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. Body weight modestly increased with sitagliptin relative to placebo (+ 0.8 vs. -0.4 kg; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with glimepiride or glimepiride plus metformin therapy. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with a modest increase in hypoglycaemia and body weight, consistent with glimepiride therapy and the observed degree of glycaemic improvement.","answer":"[[\\"sitagliptin\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DPP-4\\"], [\\"sitagliptin\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"dipeptidyl peptidase-4\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

Patients with chronic kidney disease who also have HCV infection are at higher risk for progression to end‐stage renal disease than those who have chronic kidney disease without HCV infection . Patients with both HCV infection and advanced chronic kidney disease have limited treatment options . METHODS We conducted a multicenter , open‐label , phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with the combination of the NS3/4A protease inhibitor glecaprevir and the NS5A inhibitor pibrentasvir for 12 weeks in adults who had HCV genotype 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 infection and also had compensated liver disease ( with or without cirrhosis ) with severe renal impairment , dependence on dialysis , or both . Patients had stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease and either had received no previous treatment for HCV infection or had received previous treatment with interferon or pegylated interferon , ribavirin , sofosbuvir , or a combination of these medications . The primary end point was a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment . RESULTS Among the 104 patients enrolled in the trial , 52 % had genotype 1 infection , 16 % had genotype 2 infection , 11 % had genotype 3 infection , 19 % had genotype 4 infection , and 2 % had genotype 5 or 6 infection . The sustained virologic response rate was 98 % ( 102 of 104 patients ; 95 % confidence interval , 95 to 100 ) . No patients had virologic failure during treatment , and no patients had a virologic relapse after the end of treatment . Adverse events that were reported in at least 10 % of the patients were pruritus , fatigue , and nausea . Serious adverse events were reported in 24 % of the patients . Four patients discontinued the trial treatment prematurely because of adverse events ; three of these patients had a sustained virologic response . CONCLUSIONS Treatment with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks result ed in a high rate of sustained virologic response in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease and HCV infection .

Our aim was to analyze the characteristics associated with the presence of adverse events in patients receiving this antiviral regimen , with ribavirin in cirrhotic patients . METHODS We prospect ively studied a cohort of adults with hepatitis C virus infection with Child A cirrhosis , treated for 12 weeks with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir and ribavirin  , which have been followed in an infectious diseases tertiary-care hospital . RESULTS We included 137 adult patients diagnosed with compensated cirrhosis , hepatitis C virus genotype 1b infected , 82 ( 60 % ) previously treated . We recorded 201 adverse events in 98 ( 71.5 % ) patients , with a median number of events per patient of one . The intensity of adverse events was classified as mild , moderate and severe in 50 % , 36 % and 14 % of cases , respectively . Forty-five ( 22 % ) episodes required medical intervention . The most frequently reported adverse events were pruritus 34(35 % ) , asthenia 22(22 % ) and insomnia 15(15 % ) . The presence of severe adverse events was associated with the presence of comorbidities ( p = 0.01 , OR : 9.5 , 95 % CI : 1.2 - 74.3 ) and with the presence of associated medication ( p = 0.02 , OR : 3.9 , 95 % CI : 1.08 - 14.2 ) . At the end of current treatment , 136 ( 99.2 % ) patients had undetectable viral load . CONCLUSION We found a high number of adverse events , but most of them were mild or moderate and only one quarter of them required medical intervention . Only severe adverse events were associated with comorbidities and associated medicationTitle 3:Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir Treatment in Liver or Kidney Transplant Patients With Hepatitis C Virus InfectionAbstract 3:Well‐tolerated , ribavirin‐free , pangenotypic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) treatments for transplant recipients remain a high priority . Once‐daily glecaprevir/pibrentasvir demonstrates high rates of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment ( SVR12 ) across all major HCV genotypes ( GTs ) . This trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for patients with chronic HCV GT1‐6 infection who had received a liver or kidney transplant . MAGELLAN‐2 was a phase 3 , open‐label trial conducted in patients who were ≥3 months posttransplant . Patients without cirrhosis who were HCV treatment‐naive ( GT1‐6 ) or treatment‐experienced ( GT1 , 2 , 4‐6 ; with interferon‐based therapy with or without sofosbuvir , or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin ) received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir ( 300/120 mg ) once daily for 12 weeks . The primary endpoint compared the percentage of patients  receiving glecaprevir/pibrentasvir  with SVR12 to a historic SVR12 rate based on the st and ard of care . Safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was assessed . In total , 80 liver transplant and 20 kidney transplant patients participated in the trial . Most patients had no or minimal fibrosis ( 80 % had fibrosis scores F0‐F1 ) and were infected with HCV GT1 ( 57 % ) or GT3 ( 24 % ) . The overall SVR12 was 98 % ( n/N = 98/100 ; 95 % confidence interval , 95.3%–100 % ) , which exceeded the prespecified historic st and ard‐of‐care SVR12 threshold of 94 % . One patient experienced virologic failure . One patient discontinued because of an adverse event considered to be unrelated to treatment ; this patient achieved SVR12 . Adverse events were mostly mild in severity , and laboratory abnormalities were infrequent . Conclusion : Once‐daily glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks is a well‐tolerated and efficacious , ribavirin‐free treatment for patients with chronic HCV GT1‐6 infection who have received a liver or kidney transplant .

Sixty-three patients ( 33 treatment-naïve and 30 peg-interferon/ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV)-experienced ) enrolled in a partly r and omized , open-label , multicentre , phase IIa study . Patients with F0-F3 fibrosis were r and omized ( 1:1 ) into two groups ( A1 and A2 ) , stratified according to treatment experience and METAVIR score , to receive either eight weeks ( Group A1 , n=20 ) or 12 weeks ( Group A2 , n=20 ) of treatment . Patients with compensated cirrhosis ( METAVIR F4 ) received 12 weeks of treatment ( Group B , n=23 ) . Treatment comprised simeprevir 150 mg and sofosbuvir 400 mg daily . The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment ( SVR12 ) . Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout . Overall , 92 % ( 95 % CI : 82 - 97 ) of patients achieved SVR12 ; 75 % ( 15/20 ) in Group A1 and 100 % in groups A2 and B. Patients who did not achieve SVR12 ( n=5 ) experienced viral relapse during the first 32 days following treatment and were all prior Peg-IFN/RBV null responders . The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were asymptomatic lipase increase ( 14 % ) , pruritus ( 14 % ) , headache ( 13 % ) and hyperbilirubinaemia ( 11 % ) . No patients discontinued due to TEAEs . In conclusion , simeprevir plus sofosbuvir for 12 weeks achieved a 100 % SVR rate in HCV genotype 4-infected patients with or without compensated cirrhosis ( Clinical Trials.gov : NCT02278419 ) . The AE and laboratory profile were favourable and consistent with previous data for simeprevir plus sofosbuvir in eight- and 12-week regimensTitle 5:Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients with chronic HCV and recent drug use: An integrated analysis of 7 phase III studies.Abstract 5:BACKGROUND Injection drug use is the primary mode of transmission for hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , and treatment guidelines recommend treating HCV-infected people who use drugs ; however , concerns about adherence , effectiveness , and reinfection have impeded treatment uptake . METHODS Data were pooled from seven phase III trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 8 or 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir ( G/P ) in patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1 - 6 . Patients had compensated liver disease , with or without cirrhosis , and were HCV treatment-naïve or -experienced with interferon or pegylated interferon ± ribavirin , or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin ± pegylated interferon . Patients were grouped into recent drug users ( injection drug use ≤12 months before screening , positive urine drug screen [ UDS ] , and /or drug-related adverse event ) , former drug users ( > 12 months before screening and negative UDS ) , or non-drug users . Assessment s included sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment ( SVR12 ) , treatment adherence , and safety . RESULTS Among 1819 patients , 5 % , 34 % , and 61 % were recent , former , and non-drug users , respectively . Treatment adherence and completion were high ( ≥96 % ) regardless of drug use status . SVR12 was achieved by 93 % ( n/N = 91/98 ) , 97 % ( n/N = 591/610 ) , and > 99 % ( n/N = 1106/1111 ) of recent , former , and non-drug users , respectively ( intention-to-treat analysis ) . The overall rates of virologic failure were ≤1.5 % across all three sub population s , with no HCV reinfections among recent drug users . Drug-related serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were experienced by ≤1 % of patients . CONCLUSIONS G/P is a well-tolerated and efficacious pangenotypic regimen for chronic HCV-infected people with recent or active drug useTitle 6:Hepatitis C virus infection in Australian psychiatric inpatients: A multicenter study of seroprevalence, risk factors and treatment experienceAbstract 6:Screening and treatment for hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection were not prioritised in psychiatric patients due to adverse neuropsychiatric effects of interferon therapy despite reports of high prevalence . However , with the safe new antiviral drugs , HCV eradication has become a reality in these patients . The aim of this study was to report HCV seroprevalence , risk factors and treatment model in an Australian cohort . This prospect i ve study involved patients admitted to four inpatient psychiatric units , from December 2016 to December 2017 . After pretest counselling and consent , HCV testing was done ; information on risk factors collected . A total of 260 patients ( 70 % male ) , median age 44 years ( IQR 24 ) , were studied . The HCV seroprevalence was 10.8 % ( 28/260 ) with 95 % CI 7 - 15 . Independent predictors of HCV positivity were injection drug use ( P < 0.001 , OR 44.05 , 95 % CI 7.9 - 245.5 ) , exposure to custodial stay ( P = 0.011 , OR 7.34 , 95 % CI 1.6 - 33.9 ) and age ( P = 0.011 , OR 1.09 , 95 % CI 1.02 - 1.16 ) . Eight of the 16 HCV RNA-positive patients were treated . Hepatitis nurses liaised with community mental health teams for treatment initiation and follow-up under supervision of hepatologists . Seven patients achieved sustained viral response , one achieved end of treatment response . The remaining eight patients were difficult to engage with . In conclusion , HCV prevalence was high in our cohort of psychiatric in patients . Although treatment uptake was achieved only in 50 % patients , it was successfully completed in all , with innovative models of care .

The centerpiece of the AND gate is a bisected methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) that charges the Met surrogate azidonorleucine (Anl) to tRNA(Met). Cellular protein labeling occurs only upon activation of two different promoters that drive expression of the N- and C-terminal fragments of the bisected MetRS. Anl-labeled proteins can be tagged with fluorescent dyes or affinity reagents via either copper-catalyzed or strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Protein labeling is apparent within 5 min after addition of Anl to bacterial cells in which the AND gate has been activated. This method allows spatial and temporal control of proteomic labeling and identification of proteins made in specific cellular subpopulations. The approach is demonstrated by selective labeling of proteins in bacterial cells immobilized in the center of a laminar-flow microfluidic channel, where they are exposed to overlapping, opposed gradients of inducers of the N- and C-terminal MetRS fragments. The observed labeling profile is predicted accurately from the strengths of the individual input signals.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"azidonorleucine\\", \\"methionyl\\", \\"N\\", \\"Anl\\", \\"copper\\", \\"C\\", \\"Met\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"MetRS\\", \\"methionyl-tRNA synthetase\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

One hundred fifty adult patients with PSC were enrolled in a long-term, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of high-dose UDCA (28-30 mg/kg/day) versus placebo. Liver biopsy and cholangiography were performed before randomization and after 5 years. The primary outcome measures were development of cirrhosis, varices, cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation, or death. The study was terminated after 6 years due to futility. At enrollment, the UDCA (n = 76) and placebo (n = 74) groups were similar with respect to sex, age, duration of disease, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, liver histology, and Mayo risk score. During therapy, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels decreased more in the UDCA group than the placebo group (P < 0.01), but improvements in liver tests were not associated with decreased endpoints. By the end of the study, 30 patients in the UDCA group (39%) versus 19 patients in the placebo group (26%) had reached one of the pre-established clinical endpoints. After adjustment for baseline stratification characteristics, the risk of a primary endpoint was 2.3 times greater for patients on UDCA than for those on placebo (P < 0.01) and 2.1 times greater for death, transplantation, or minimal listing criteria (P = 0.038). Serious adverse events were more common in the UDCA group than the placebo group (63% versus 37% [P < 0.01]). Conclusion: Long-term, high-dose UDCA therapy is associated with improvement in serum liver tests in PSC but does not improve survival and was associated with higher rates of serious adverse events.Title 2:High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid in primary sclerosing cholangitis: a 5-year multicenter, randomized, controlled study.Abstract 2:There is no medical treatment of proven benefit for primary sclerosing cholangitis. This study aimed at studying the effect of a higher dose of ursodeoxycholic acid than previously used on survival, symptoms, biochemistry, and quality of life in this disease.                A randomized placebo-controlled study was performed in tertiary and secondary gastroenterology units. A total of 219 patients were randomized to 17 to 23 mg/kg body weight per day of ursodeoxycholic acid (n = 110) or placebo (n = 109) for 5 years. Follow-up data are available from 97 patients randomized to ursodeoxycholic acid and for 101 randomized to placebo. Quality of life was assessed by using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey.                The combined end point \\"death or liver transplantation\\" occurred in 7 of 97 (7.2%) patients in the ursodeoxycholic acid group vs 11 of 101 (10.9%) patients in the placebo group (P = .368; 95% confidence interval, -12.2% to 4.7%). The occurrence of liver transplantation as a single end point showed a similar positive trend for ursodeoxycholic acid treatment (5/97 [5.2%] vs 8/101 [7.9%]; 95% confidence interval, -10.4% to 4.6%). Three ursodeoxycholic acid and 4 placebo patients died from cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 placebo patient died from liver failure. Alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase tended to decrease during the first 6 months. There were no differences between the 2 groups in symptoms or quality of life. Analyses of serum ursodeoxycholic acid concentration gave no evidence that noncompliance may have influenced the results.                This study found no statistically significant beneficial effect of a higher dose of ursodeoxycholic acid than previously used on survival or prevention of cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis.Title 3:A preliminary trial of high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid in primary sclerosing cholangitis.Abstract 3:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is used for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases including primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) for which it has a positive effect on laboratory values, may delay the development of liver failure and prolong the transplant-free disease period. Standard doses of UDCA (8-15 mg/kg daily) have been shown to be ineffective in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We report on the findings (clinical, biochemical, histological, and cholangiographic) and side effects of a 2-year double-blind placebo-controlled preliminary study of high-dose UDCA in PSC patients.                Twenty-six patients with PSC were randomized to high-dose (20 mg/kg daily) UDCA or placebo. Cholangiography and liver biopsy were performed at entry and after 2 years. Symptoms, clinical signs, and liver biochemical tests were recorded at 3 monthly intervals.                High-dose UDCA did not influence symptoms, but there was a significant improvement in liver biochemistry (serum alkaline phosphatase, P = 0.03; gamma-glutamyl transferase, P = 0.01) and a significant reduction in progression in cholangiographic appearances (P = 0.015) and liver fibrosis as assessed by disease staging (P = 0.05). In the treatment group, a significant increase in total bile acids and saturation with UDCA >70% confirmed patient compliance. No significant side effects were reported.                High-dose UDCA may be of clinical benefit in PSC, but trials with a larger number of participants and of longer duration are required to establish whether the effect of high-dose UDCA on liver biochemistry, histology, and cholangiography in patients with PSC is translated into improved long-term survival.Title 4:Ursodiol for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Mayo Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis-Ursodeoxycholic Acid Study Group.Abstract 4:There is no satisfactory medical therapy for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) benefits patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, another cholestatic liver disease.                From May 1989 to July 1995, we enrolled 105 patients with well-documented primary sclerosing cholangitis in a randomized, double-blind study comparing ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day in divided doses) with placebo. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure, defined as death; liver transplantation; histologic progression by two stages (of four) or progression to cirrhosis; the development of varices, ascites, or encephalopathy; sustained quadrupling of the serum bilirubin concentration; marked worsening of fatigue or pruritus; inability to tolerate the drug; or voluntary withdrawal from the study.                We analyzed data on the 51 patients in each group with at least 3 months of follow-up; the median follow-up was 2.2 years. There was no significant difference between the groups in time to treatment failure (relative risk of treatment failure in the ursodiol group, 1.01; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.7). During the first two years of follow-up, treatment was unsuccessful in 17 of 32 patients (53 percent) in the placebo group and 16 of 31 (52 percent) in the ursodiol group. There were also no differences in time to treatment failure for patients with early-stage disease or in time to liver transplantation. Ursodiol, but not placebo, was associated with improvement in serum alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and albumin levels at one and two years.                In a group of patients with well-defined primary sclerosing cholangitis, ursodiol provided no clinical benefit.Title 5:Ursodeoxycholic acid for treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: a placebo-controlled trial.Abstract 5:The efficacy and safety of ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Fourteen patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis documented by cholestatic serum enzyme pattern, liver histological appearance and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were included in the trial. Six patients received ursodeoxycholic acid (13 to 15 mg/kg body wt/day), and eight patients received placebo. Two patients had to be withdrawn from the study, one because of UDCA-related diarrhea and the other because of worsening of the disease during placebo treatment. Patients in the ursodeoxycholic acid group improved significantly during 1 yr of treatment with respect to serum levels of bilirubin (median = -50%), alkaline phosphatase (median = -67%), gamma-glutamyltransferase (median = -53%), AST (median = -54%) and ALT (median = -36%) compared with the placebo group, but not with respect to serum levels of hydrophobic bile acids. During ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, histopathological features also improved significantly, as evaluated by multiparametric score. Expression of human leukocyte antigen class I molecules appeared to be markedly reduced on liver cells after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. We conclude that ursodeoxycholic acid is beneficial in reducing disease activity in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.Title 6:Ursodeoxycholic acid does not improve the clinical course of primary sclerosing cholangitis over a 2-year period.Abstract 6:Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to be a useful agent in the clinical management of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Its efficacy is presumed to be based upon its ability to act as a detergent and to incite a choleresis. Recent additional data suggest it also reduces HLA antigen expression on liver and biliary epithelial cells and impairs T cell reactivity.                A randomized controlled study of 59 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis was performed over a 24 months period with 3 groups being studied. Group I consisted of 20 patients who were given ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg orally twice a day; group II consisted of 19 patients who were given colchicine 0.6 mg orally BID; and group III was an untreated medical control group. All three groups were seen at regular 3-month intervals and had quarterly, annual and terminal studies performed to assess their disease status.                No difference between groups was evident after two full years of therapy when parameters of liver injury, liver function, liver size and hepatic copper content were compared between groups. Similarly, no difference in ERCP findings was evident between groups either at entry or after two years of therapy.                These data suggest that ursodeoxycholic acid is no better than colchicine or simple medical follow-up. Thus, neither ursodeoxycholic acid or colchicine can be considered to be effective therapies for primary sclerosing cholangitis.Title 7:Effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on liver and bile duct disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis. A 3-year pilot study with a placebo-controlled study period.Abstract 7:Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a cholestatic disease of the liver characterized by progressive fibrotic inflammation and obliteration of the extra- and/or intrahepatic bile ducts. There is no effective therapy. We, therefore, studied the safety and efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis with or without additional ulcerative colitis. In a 1-year ursodeoxycholic acid treatment period, which preceded the controlled study period, ursodeoxycholic acid was well tolerated in 22 of 24 patients with ulcerative colitis and in all three patients without ulcerative colitis. In two patients with ulcerative colitis the dose of 750 mg ursodeoxycholic acid/day led to diarrhea, but following reduction of the dose to 500 and 250 mg/day ursodeoxycholic acid was well tolerated. After 1 year of ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ursodeoxycholic acid 750 mg/day or placebo. All of them finished a double-blind, placebo-controlled study period. During ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, the liver enzymes improved markedly. The difference in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase between the placebo and ursodeoxycholic acid group was significant (p < 0.05). Following ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, pruritus and fatigue improved in half of the patients but the difference between the placebo and ursodeoxycholic acid group was not significant. According to the ethical guidelines, after 3 months of placebo treatment, the controlled study had to be discontinued because of a more than twofold increase of serum transaminases in 8/10 patients on placebo. After the end of the controlled study, all patients were continuously treated with ursodeoxycholic acid for up to 4 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","answer":"We did not find enough evidence to support or refute the use of bile acids in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  A new methodology for the automatic recognition of musical recordings is presented. A system has been developed that performs recognition among a set of specific musical recordings. The system claims a high rate of success (greater than 86%), even when the unknown compositions have suffered from up to a medium degree of distortion. It comprises a database of musical characteristics that correspond to a set of model musical recordings. These characteristics are derived by applying novel feature extraction algorithms to every model musical recording selected. In order to determine whether an unknown musical recording corresponds to a piece represented in the database, the same feature extraction algorithm is applied to it, and the characteristics thus derived are compared to the database contents by means of a set of criteria. The system can operate in parallel, essentially in real time, even for a considerable number of model musical recordings, as long as the hardware necessary is available. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Previously, we proposed a histogram-based quick signal search method called Time-Series Active Search (TAS). TAS is a method of searching through long audio or video recordings for a specified segment, based on signal similarity. TAS is fast; it can search through a 24-hour recording in 1 second after a query-independent preprocessing. However, an even faster method is required when we consider a huge amount of audio archives, for example a month's worth of recordings. Thus, we propose a preprocessing method that significantly accelerates TAS. The core part of this method comprises a global histogram clustering of long signals and a pruning scheme using those clusters. Tests using broadcast recording indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a search speed approximately 3 to 30 times faster than TAS. In these tests, the search results are exactly the same as with TAS. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  This paper describes the development of an audio fingerprint called AudioDNA designed to be robust against several distortions including those related to radio broadcasting. A complete system, covering also a fast and efficient method for comparing observed fingerprints against a huge database with reference fingerprints is described. The promising results achieved with the first prototype system observing music titles as well as commercials are presented. INTRODUCTION A monitoring system able to automatically generate play lists of registered songs can be a valuable tool for copyright enforcement organizations and for companies reporting statistics on the music broadcast. Technology able to listen to audio in order to identify songs without using external metadata or embedded watermarking is commonly known as Audio Fingerprinting. In a general Audio Fingerprinting scheme, the system generates a unique fingerprint of audio material based on an analysis of the acoustic properties of the audio itself. The fingerprint is compared against a database of fingerprints to identify a song. The difficulty inherent in the task of identifying broadcast audio material is mainly due to the difference of quality of the original titles, usually stored on Audio CD and the quality of the broadcast ones. The song is transmitted partially, the presenter talks on top of different fragments, the piece is maybe played faster and several manipulation effects are applied to increase the listener’s psychoacoustic impact (compressors, enhancers, equalization, bassbooster, etc). Moreover, in broadcast audio streams there are no markers indicating the begin and the end of the songs. Such a system also has to be fast because it must do comparisons with several thousand songs. This affects the memory and computation requisites since the system should observe several radio stations, give results on-line and should not be very expensive in terms of hardware. The paper describes an approach to the problem. After introducing the concept of audio fingerprinting, it proposes a modeling of audio aimed at being robust to different distortions in an adverse environment: radio broadcast. Along with an explanation of the CANO ET AL. ROBUST MODELING FOR SONG DETECTION AES 112 CONVENTION, MUNICH, GERMANY, 2002 MAY 10–13 2 fingerprint matching algorithms, we present some preliminary results and conclusions. AUDIO FINGERPRINTING Fingerprinting, or content-based identification (CBID), technologies work by extracting acoustic relevant characteristics of a piece of audio content and storing them in a database. When presented with an unidentified piece of audio content, characteristics of that piece are calculated and matched against those stored in the database. Using complex matching algorithms and acoustic fingerprints different versions of a single recording can be identified as the same music title [1], [2]. This is different to an alternative existing solution to monitor audio content: Audio Watermarking. In Audio Watermarking [3], research on psychoacoustics is conducted so that an arbitrary message, the watermark, can be embedded in a recording without altering the perception of the sound. In Audio Fingerprinting, the message is automatically derived from the perceptually most relevant components of sound. This makes it less vulnerable in theory to attacks and distortions since trying to modifying this message, the fingerprint, means alteration of the quality of the sound [4]. Independently of the specific approach to extract the content-based compact signature, a common architecture can be devised to describe the functionality of fingerprinting [1]. METADATA: Track Id Artist 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  This paper explores modulation frequency features with subband normalization for audio identification. Our main goal is to find features for audio fingerprinting that are invariant to time and frequency distortions, both unintentional and intentional. Two-dimensional features, called “joint acoustic and modulation frequency,” are proposed. The paper describes these features and corresponding cross entropy classification. Experimental results show that standard spectral features are inadequate when frequency distortion occurs, as in low bit rate coding or equalization. In contrast, our proposed normalized modulation frequency features can provide accurate fingerprints, even when time and frequency distortions are imposed on music passages. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  A key problem faced by audio identification, classification, and retrieval systems is the mapping of high-dimensional audio input data into informative lower-dimensional feature vectors. This paper explores an automatic dimensionality reduction algorithm called Distortion Discriminant Analysis (DDA). Each layer of DDA projects its input into directions which maximize the SNR for a given set of distortions. Multiple layers efficiently extract features over a wide temporal window. The audio input to DDA undergoes perceptually-relevant preprocessing and de-equalization, to further suppress distortions. We apply DDA to the task of identifying audio clips in an incoming audio stream, based on matching stored audio fingerprints. We show excellent test results on matching input fingerprints against 36 hours of stored audio data.Literature Review:","answer":"Once on a time-frequency representation, additional transformations are applied in order to generate the final acoustic vectors. In this step, we find a great diversity of algorithms. The objective is again to reduce the dimensionality and, at the same time, to increase the invariance to distortions. It is very common to include knowledge of the transduction stages of the human auditory system to extract more perceptually meaningful parameters. Therefore, many systems extract several features performing a critical-band analysis of the spectrum (see Fig. 3 ). In BIB004  , Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) are used. In BIB001 , the choice is the Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM), which is an estimation of the tone-like or noise-like quality for a band in the spectrum. Papaodysseus et al. BIB002 presented the \\"band representative vectors\\", which are an ordered list of indexes of bands with prominent tones (i.e. with peaks with significant amplitude). Energy of each band is used by Kimura et al. BIB003 . Haitsma et al. use the energies of 33 bark-scaled bands to obtain their \\"hash string,\\" which is the sign of the energy band differences (both in the time and the frequency axis)  . Sukittanon and Atlas claim that spectral estimates and related features only are inadequate when audio channel distortion occurs BIB005 . They propose modulation frequency analysis to characterize the timevarying behavior of audio signals. In this case, features correspond to the geometric mean of the modulation frequency estimation of the energy of 19 bark-spaced band-filters. Approaches from music information retrieval include features that have proved valid for comparing sounds: harmonicity, bandwidth, loudness  . Burges et al. point out that the features commonly used are heuristic, and as such, may not be optimal BIB006 . For that reason, they use a modified Karhunen-Loéve transform, the Oriented Principal Component Analysis (OPCA), to find the optimal features in an \\"unsupervised\\" way. If PCA (KL) finds a set of orthogonal directions which maximize the signal variance, OPCA obtains a set of possible non-orthogonal directions which take some predefined distortions into account."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The anti-amnesic effect of minaprine on the cycloheximide-induced memory impairment was also antagonized by a serotonin (5-HT) releaser, p-chloroamphetamine, and by a 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, whereas a 5-HT1A-selective agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, was inactive.

We excluded case reports and searched all-language articles for review and repeated until the final drafting. The search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database.

Nine studies observed urinary viral shedding in urine from 41 patients. The total incidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%, compared to 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood and stool, respectively.

HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DRB1*17-bearing haplotypes and interactions at the HLA-DRB1 locus increase risk of MS but it has taken large samples to identify resistance HLA-DRB1 alleles. In this investigation of 7, 093 individuals from 1, 432 MS families, we have assessed the validity, mode of inheritance, associated genotypes, and the interactions of HLA-DRB1 resistance alleles. HLA-DRB1*14-, HLA-DRB1*11-, HLA-DRB1*01-, and HLA-DRB1*10-bearing haplotypes are protective overall but they appear to operate by different mechanisms. The first type of resistance allele is characterised by HLA-DRB1*14 and HLA-DRB1*11. Each shows a multiplicative mode of inheritance indicating a broadly acting suppression of risk, but a different degree of protection. In contrast, a second type is exemplified by HLA-DRB1*10 and HLA-DRB1*01. These alleles are significantly protective when they interact specifically in trans with HLA-DRB1*15-bearing haplotypes. HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DRB1*10 do not interact with HLA-DRB1*17, implying that several mechanisms may be operative in major histocompatibility complex–associated MS susceptibility, perhaps analogous to the resistance alleles. There are major practical implications for risk and for the exploration of mechanisms in animal models. Restriction of antigen presentation by HLA-DRB1*15 seems an improbably simple mechanism of major histocompatibility complex–associated susceptibility.Introduction:Multiple sclerosis( MS) is a complex neurological disease with a strong genetic predisposition, as demonstrated by genetic–epidemiological studies[1–3]. However, the mapping of putative susceptibility genes has proven difficult. The imputation of many non–major histocompatibility complex( MHC) genes by analogies with experimental models and the drop in concordance between monozygotic and dizygotic twins, has not been validated by genome scans. In genome-wide studies with enough power to detect relatively small effects, the MHC has consistently been the only locus linked to MS[4]. This indicates that the MHC is the key susceptibility locus in MS and other susceptibility genes contribute relatively little to overall risk[31]. Accordingly, polymorphisms at the major histocompatibility locus( MHC) have undergone renewed study. Genes in the HLA class I region were originally shown to be associated with MS[5, 6] but stronger associations were subsequently observed in the class II region of the MHC[7]. This class II association has been fine mapped to the extended haplotype HLA-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602-DRB1*1501-DRB5*0101[8, 9]. The human leukocyte antigen( HLA) association in a large Canadian MS population was recently revisited[10] and the situation was found to be much more complex than originally conceived. The study of interactions was only productive when a large sample was analysed( n = 4, 347 individuals). The HLA-DRB1*17 allele has long been known to be associated with susceptibility in other groups, in particular the Sardinian and the Swedish MS populations[11, 12] and this was confirmed in the Canadian population. There were clear indications of resistance alleles, in particular, HLA-DRB1*14, and the same approach was recently repeated in a study of American and European families[13] with similar results. Additionally, HLA-DRB1*08 and DRB1*01 showed effects on MS risk in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15[10]. We present here an investigation of an expanded series of Canadian MS families aimed at elucidating the inheritance pattern of MS susceptibility and resistance alleles.Discussion:The only consistent genetic association with MS in Northern Europeans has been with extended MHC haplotypes, especially those containing HLA-DRB1*1501[8]. A previously linked region on Chromosome 5p13[14] has been shown to harbor the interleukin 7 receptor gene( IL7R), an additional MS susceptibility locus[15], but any effect of IL7R is small( OR = 1. 3), and when compared to the MHC( genotypic OR = 5. 4, p = 5 × 10−33), its effect size is clearly too small to influence inheritance patterns. The MS MHC association has been used to add to circumstantial evidence supporting an autoimmune reaction against myelin-related antigens presented to T cells in the restricting context of HLA-DRB1*1501. However, the specific susceptibility gene( e. g., HLA-DR or HLA-DQ) or the specific mechanism of class II determined susceptibility has yet to be convincingly elucidated. Recent scans of the MHC region with a large number of markers do show evidence for the involvement of HLA-DRB1 only[16]. However, the paradigm is more complex than one in which the HLA-DRB1*15 allele acts solely to increase MS risk[10, 13]. Our previous investigation showed the presence of HLA-DRB1*14 as a resistance allele, HLA-DRB1*17 as a susceptibility allele, and the more compelling observation that alleles are interacting and that it is the genotype that determines MS risk[10]. This expanded Canadian dataset extends these results. We confirm that HLA-DRB1*15- and HLA-DRB1*17-bearing haplotypes increase risk of MS, and HLA-DRB1*14-bearing haplotypes are protective, and show that HLA-DRB1*11-bearing haplotypes are novel and statistically significant resistance haplotypes( Table 6). To our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of HLA susceptibility and resistance alleles for multiple sclerosis. The protective effect of the HLA-DRB1*14 haplotype is shown to be multiplicative and completely abrogates the risk associated with HLA-DRB1*15( Table 7). HLA-DRB1*14 homozygotes were not observed in our sample( either affected or unaffected relatives) in order to assess a possible increased protection conferred by HLA-DRB1*14 homozygosity, analogous to the increased susceptibility conferred by HLA-DRB1*15 and DRB1*17 homozygosity. In populations with a high frequency of HLA-DRB1*14, e. g., China[17], where the existence of HLA-DRB1*14 homozygotes may be substantial, the prevalence of MS is extremely low. Thus, HLA-DRB1*14 could influence the distribution of MS and suggests more broadly that the HLA-DRB1 genotype, which reflects more complex interactions, may be a major determinant of the heretofore unexplained geography of this disease. HLA-DRB1*11 haplotypes also show a multiplicative mode of inheritance( Table 7). The protective effect of HLA-DRB1*11 over HLA-DRB1*15 appears to be weaker than that of HLA-DRB1*14, but both reduce the risk associated with HLA-DRB1*17. We now show that HLA-DRB1*10-bearing haplotypes are similar to HLA-DRB1*01-bearing haplotypes in that they are both significantly under transmitted in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15, showing a clear protective effect in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15( Table 5). HLA-DRB1*10 and HLA-DRB1*01 were not under transmitted in the presence of HLA-DRB1*17( unpublished data). HLA-DRB1*15 heterozygotes have an increased risk of MS with an OR of 2. 9( Tables 1 and 7). The HLA-DRB1*15/15 offspring genotype also increases risk over HLA-DRB1*X/X by 5. 4-fold, and is in keeping with an additive mode of inheritance for HLA-DRB1*15, similar to other studies[12, 18–21]. When the relative effects of HLA-DRB1*15 versus HLA-DRB1*17 were compared, HLA-DRB1*15 was found to be preferentially transmitted, most notably when transmissions from HLA-DRB1*17/15 heterozygous parents were counted, thereby ruling out a codominant model for these two risk alleles. This is also in keeping with previous observations[10]. Past studies have reported that HLA-DRB1*17 acts in a recessive manner[12, 13, 21], but the sample size has been smaller than the one in the present study. In this Canadian sample, HLA-DRB1*17 haplotypes act in an additive fashion( Tables 2 and 7). HLA-DRB1*08 increases risk significantly with HLA-DRB1*15 in trans. Thus, HLA-DRB1*08 shows a synergistic mode of inheritance with HLA-DRB1*15. HLA-DRB1*17 shows no interaction with HLA-DRB1*08( unpublished data), further highlighting the difference between HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DRB1*17 haplotypes. As yet, no molecular or functional explanation can be given for the dominant-negative effects of HLA-DRB1*14 and DRB1*11, the complementary effects of HLA-DRB1*08, and the protective nature of HLA-DRB1*01 and DRB1*10 in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15. It has been speculated that poor engagement of the encephalitogenic peptide in the context of HLA-DRB1*14 acts to alter the immune response in a dominant-negative manner and thereby reduce the effect of HLA-DRB1*15[13]. Another explanation is that HLA-DRB1*14 binds one or more peptides that can delete autoreactive T cells. Alternatively, other risk factors present on HLA-DRB1 haplotypes could be interacting in cis and trans to reduce MS risk. HLA-DRB1 allelic association with MS susceptibility and resistance may reflect linkage disequilibrium with the true disease locus/loci. The identity and location of these putative variants are unknown and will be difficult to identify given the high linkage disequilibrium present within the MHC, although it is likely that these variants, if they exist, will be found in the class II region[16, 22]. Susceptibility and resistance haplotypes may need revisiting if/when true or additional MS MHC susceptibility loci are uncovered. As mentioned previously[10], HLA-DRB1*14, DRB1*10, and DRB1*01 share the extended HLA-DQ haplotype HLA-DQA1*01-DQB1*05, which may protect against MS. However, HLA-DRB1*11 haplotypes do not share these HLA-DQ alleles. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis suggests that HLA-DRB1*10 and DRB1*01 share the same allelic lineage( DR1 group) and HLA-DRB1*11, DRB1*14, and DRB1*12 belong to the DR52 group[23]. Variants on the similar HLA-DRB1*10 and DRB1*01 haplotypes could enable them to be protective in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15. HLA-DRB1*14 and DRB1*11 haplotypes may also possess similar polymorphisms that give them a dominant-protective effect. It has been shown that low immune responsiveness to certain antigens are HLA-linked dominant traits[24]; this was proposed to be caused by an immune suppression gene present on certain HLA haplotypes that controls the generation of antigen-specific suppressor T cells[25]. Recently, HLA-DRB5*0101 has been shown to reduce the number of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models[26]. It is conceivable that dominant variants on HLA-DRB1*14 and HLA-DRB1*11 haplotypes can generate T cells that suppress autoreactive T cells, even those generated by HLA-DRB1*15. This study highlights the need for a large sample size and systematic methods of analysis( e. g., stratified TDT is a more sensitive measure to detect interactions between alleles than regression) in order to unravel the complexity of HLA associations. Further studies of HLA expression, and/or animal models incorporating the susceptibility and resistance genotypes, are warranted to explain these complex interactions. In the meantime, genotyping for susceptibility and resistance alleles may have some practical value in prospective studies of prevention.","answer":"Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is a complex neurological disease with a strong genetic component . With the possible exception of a weak association at Chromosome 5p , the major histocompatibility complex is the only locus consistently linked to MS . Because of this the major histocompatibility complex has recently undergone renewed attention . A region at or near the gene HLA-DRB1 influences the risk of MS . HLA-DRB1 comes in over 400 different forms ( or alleles ) . A common form in Europe , named 1501 , increases risk of MS by 3-fold . In this paper , to our knowledge the largest-ever analysis of this region in MS , we examine the inheritance of newly discovered HLA-DRB1 MS resistance alleles , namely HLA-DRB1*14 , HLA-DRB1*11 , *10 , and HLA-DRB1*01 . We show that HLA-DRB1*14 and HLA-DRB1*11 are dominantly protective; e . g . , HLA-DRB1*14 significantly reduces the risk associated with HLA-DRB1*15 when they are inherited together . This may explain , in part , why MS is rare in Asia; there , the HLA-DRB1*14 allele is frequent . HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DRB1*10 are protective only in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15 . HLA-DRB1*14 and HLA-DRB1*11 haplotypes and HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DRB1*10 haplotypes share common ancestral origins and this may be why the alleles can be grouped in terms of their protective nature .

This is because overexpression of proteins, especially enzymes, has been implicated frequently in the diseased state of the cells. Here, we disclose our findings with an enzyme-responsive dendrimer assembly.</p><p>Dendrimers are interesting as a macromolecular structure for a variety of applications, due to their globular shape and the high degree of control over their size.4 In the area of enzyme-responsive systems, a novel class of dendrimers called \\"self-immolative dendrimers\\" has been reported, in which all covalently appended drug/active molecules are released by a single enzymatic trigger at the dendritic core.5 A useful complement to this approach involves non-covalently sequestering the guest molecules and releasing them in response to an enzymatic trigger. This approach is attractive because: (i) hydrophobic guests are encapsulated by the water-soluble dendrimers and therefore the hydrophobicity of the molecule will not affect the fidelity of the approach. (ii) guest molecules, such as drugs, need not be converted to prodrugs and thus the molecular design is simplified and the applicability can be rather broad. We report here on the enzymatic disassembly of dendrimer-based micelles. Dendritic micellar assemblies are also appealing because: (i) these macromolecules exhibit low critical aggregation concentrations (CACs) and high stabilities, compared to their small molecule counterparts;6,7 (ii) the systematic control over the molecular weight of the dendrimer through generational variations provides an opportunity for differential release rate.</p><p>We have recently reported a distinct class of amphiphilic biaryl dendrimers that form micelle-like and inverse micelle-like structures in polar and apolar solvents, respectively.7 The fact that hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) is crucial for the formation of micellar assemblies in these dendrimer presents an opportunity for disassembly where by the HLB could be disturbed in response to an enzymatic trigger. Unlike classical amphiphilic dendrimers, our facially amphiphilic dendrimers form micellar assemblies by the aggregation of several dendritic molecules due to the orthogonal placement of hydrophilic and lipophilic units in every repeat unit of the dendrimer. To enzymatically trigger the disassembly in these assemblies, we installed enzyme cleavable ester moieties as lipophilic units. We hypothesized that the enzymatic cleavage of these lipophilic units will render the dendrimer hydrophilic and cause deaggregation. Since the hydrophobic container property of these dendrimers in water is predicated based on the micelle-like aggregation, the enzyme-triggered deaggregation event should result in a concomitant release of the sequestered hydrophobic guest molecules (Figure 1).</p><p>The structures of dendrons (G0-G3) with a hexyl ester functionality as the lipophilic unit and pentaethylene glycol (PEG) as the hydrophilic unit are shown in Chart 1. PEG was chosen to avoid non-specific interactions. The dendrimers were synthesized in a modular fashion, where the enzyme-sensitive functionalities were installed using the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction.8 Prior to testing the disassembly, we investigated the micellar behavior of these dendrons in water by encapsulating pyrene as a probe. CACs of these dendrons were determined using the concentration dependence on excitation spectrum of pyrene.8 As expected, the CAC of the small molecule surfactant G0 dendron was found to be in mM range, whereas G1-G3 dendrons exhibited CACs of 4.3, 0.7 and 0.3 µM respectively.</p><p>The enzyme-induced disassembly was first investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies. The assembly size in a 25 µM solution of G1 dendron was about 100 nm. Upon addition of a 0.1 µM solution of Porcine Liver Esterase (PLE), we were gratified to find a systematic decrease in size of G1 dendron assembly with time, finally reaching around 10 nm after 16 hrs (Figure 2a). The final size (10 nm) is identical to the size of enzyme. This indicates that the final unaggregated water-soluble dendrons are not discernible by DLS. To further test whether the disassembly occurs solely due to the enzymatic hydrolysis of ester functionalities, PLE was added to a solution of a structurally similar dendron G1-control (Chart 1)7b that lacks ester functionalities. The lack of disassembly in this case supports the enzyme-specific disassembly of the G1 micelle-like assembly.8</p><p>We were also interested in the generation dependence of the disassembly with respect to the relative kinetics of disassembly. We conceived that the size of the dendrons will have an effect on this kinetics. For comparison, we maintained identical concentrations of the ester functionalities in all generations. Upon exposure to PLE, G2 assembly reduced to 10 nm in 24 hrs, while G3 took 36 hrs to reach the same size.8 This generation dependence of the size evolution is possibly because the ester functionalities are less accessible to the enzyme in the tightly packed higher generation dendrons. In other words, the higher generation dendrons sterically protect the enzymatic degradation of the ester functionalities. The rapid decrease in the size observed for G0 further supports this hypothesis.8</p><p>It is reasonable to expect that the disassembly would effect a concomitant release of any hydrophobic guest molecule sequestered within the micellar interior. To test this, PLE was added to the pyrene-encapsulated dendrons (G0-G3), where a systematic decrease in pyrene fluorescence over time was observed (Figure 2b).8 The temporal evolution of pyrene fluorescence indicates that the disassembly is indeed accompanied by the guest release. Also, no pyrene release was observed with G1-control as expected (Figure 2b).8 Three features are noteworthy: (i) rate of guest release decreases systematically with increasing dendron generation, which is consistent with the DLS data; (ii) the burst release observed in G0 is also consistent with DLS; (iii) the maximum dye release observed in the case of dendrons reached a plateau at about 50%. We attribute this to the possibility that the rather hydrophobic backbone of our biaryl dendrimers is capable of solvating a small amount of pyrene. This was supported by the significant pyrene encapsulation capability of the hydrolyzed G2 carboxylic acid-containing dendron.8</p><p>In summary, we have designed dendrimer-based amphiphilic assemblies that can non-covalently sequester hydrophobic guest molecules and release these guests in response to an enzymatic trigger. This is achieved by incorporating the enzyme-sensitive functionalities at the lipophilic face of the dendrons. This feature causes a change in the HLB upon encountering the enzyme to effect disassembly and guest molecule release. The non-covalent nature of binding and release of guest molecules is likely to further open up the repertoire of dendrimers in enzyme-responsive drug delivery systems and biosensors.</p><p>Schematic representation of the enzyme-induced disassembly of dendritic micellar assemblies and guest release.</p><p>Disassembly of dendritic micellar assemblies upon exposure to PLE (a) size evoluation of G1 dendritic assembly using DLS.

Disassembly and the ensuing release of non-covalently bound guest molecules are of great interest due to the implications in areas such as drug delivery and sensing. Achieving these with a protein as the stimulus is of even greater importance, because proteins are the primary indicators of biological imbalances. We have achieved the disassembly of the nanocontainers by disturbing the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance in amphiphilic dendrimer building blocks."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common form of autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia, and is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Heterozygous FH is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and early-onset cardiovascular disease, whereas homozygous FH results in more severe LDL cholesterol elevation with death by 20 years of age. We present here the case of an African-American female FH patient presenting with a myocardial infarction at the age of 48, recurrent angina pectoris and numerous coronary artery stents. Her pretreated LDL cholesterol levels were more typical of a homozygous FH pattern and she was resistant to conventional lipid-lowering treatment, yet her other clinical parameters were not necessarily consistent with homozygous FH. Genetic testing revealed two LDLR variants on the same chromosome: one a novel missense mutation in exon 14 (Cys681Gly) and the other a promoter variant (IVS1-217C>T) previously shown to result in increased LDLR transcription. Disease-associated PCSK9 or APOB mutations were not identified in this individual. Overall, her genetic and clinical profile suggests that enhanced expression of the mutant LDLR allele resulted in a severe phenotype with characteristics of both heterozygous and homozygous FH.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"LDLR\\", \\"APOB\\", \\"low-density lipoprotein\\", \\"PCSK9\\", \\"low-density lipoprotein receptor\\", \\"LDL\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

To model the number ofinfections over time we need to specify a serialinterval distribution g with density g(T), (the time between when a person gets infected and whenthey subsequently infect another other people), which we choose to be Gamma distributed:g ~ Gamma (6.50.62). The serial interval distribution is shown below in Figure 7 and is assumed to be the same for allcountries. Figure 7: Serial interval distribution g with a mean of 6.5 days. Given the serial interval distribution, the number of infections Eamon a given day t, and country, m,is given by the following discrete convolution function:_ t—1Cam — Ram ZT=0 Cr,mgt—‘r rwhere, similarto the probability ofdeath function, the daily serial interval is discretized byfs+0.51.5gs = T=s—0.Sg(T)dT fors = 2,3, and 91 = fT=Og(T)dT. Infections today depend on the number of infections in the previous days, weighted by the discretizedserial interval distribution. This weighting is then scaled by the country-specific time-Varyingreproduction number, Ram, that models the average number of secondary infections at a given time. The functional form for the time-Varying reproduction number was chosen to be as simple as possibleto minimize the impact of strong prior assumptions: we use a piecewise constant function that scalesRam from a baseline prior R0,m and is driven by known major non-pharmaceutical interventionsoccurring in different countries and times. We included 6 interventions, one of which is constructedfrom the other 5 interventions, which are timings of school and university closures (k=l), self—isolatingif ill (k=2), banning of public events (k=3), any government intervention in place (k=4), implementinga partial or complete lockdown (k=5) and encouraging social distancing and isolation (k=6). We denotethe indicator variable for intervention k E 1,2,3,4,5,6 by IkI’m, which is 1 if intervention k is in placein country m at time t and 0 otherwise. The covariate ”any government intervention” (k=4) indicatesif any of the other 5 interventions are in effect,i.e.14’t’m equals 1 at time t if any of the interventionsk E 1,2,3,4,5 are in effect in country m at time t and equals 0 otherwise. Covariate 4 has theinterpretation of indicating the onset of major government intervention. The effect of eachintervention is assumed to be multiplicative. Ram is therefore a function ofthe intervention indicatorsIk’t’m in place at time t in country m:Ram : R0,m eXp(— 212:1 O(Rheum)-The exponential form was used to ensure positivity of the reproduction number, with R0,mconstrained to be positive as it appears outside the exponential. The impact of each intervention onRam is characterised by a set of parameters 0(1, ...,OL6, with independent prior distributions chosento beock ~ Gamma(. 5,1). The impacts ock are shared between all m countries and therefore they are informed by all availabledata. The prior distribution for R0 was chosen to beR0,m ~ Normal(2.4, IKI) with K ~ Normal(0,0.5),Once again, K is the same among all countries to share information. We assume that seeding of new infections begins 30 days before the day after a country hascumulatively observed 10 deaths. From this date, we seed our model with 6 sequential days ofinfections drawn from cl’m,...,66’m~EXponential(T), where T~Exponential(0.03). These seedinfections are inferred in our Bayesian posterior distribution. We estimated parameters jointly for all 11 countries in a single hierarchical model. Fitting was donein the probabilistic programming language Stan,19 using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)sampler. We ran 8 chains for 4000 iterations with 2000 iterations of warmup and a thinning factor 4to obtain 2000 posterior samples. Posterior convergence was assessed using the Rhat statistic and bydiagnosing divergent transitions of the HMC sampler. Prior-posterior calibrations were also performed(see below). 8.3 ValidationWe validate accuracy of point estimates of our model using cross-Validation. In our cross-validationscheme, we leave out 3 days of known death data (non-cumulative) and fit our model. We forecastwhat the model predicts for these three days. We present the individual forecasts for each day, aswell as the average forecast for those three days. The cross-validation results are shown in the Figure8. Figure 8: Cross-Validation results for 3-day and 3-day aggregatedforecastsFigure 8 provides strong empirical justification for our model specification and mechanism. Ouraccurate forecast over a three-day time horizon suggests that our fitted estimates for Rt areappropriate and plausible. Along with from point estimates we all evaluate our posterior credible intervals using the Rhatstatistic. The Rhat statistic measures whether our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains haveconverged to the equilibrium distribution (the correct posterior distribution). Figure 9 shows the Rhatstatistics for all of our parametersFigure 9: Rhat statistics - values close to 1 indicate MCMC convergence. Figure 9 indicates that our MCMC have converged. In fitting we also ensured that the MCMC samplerexperienced no divergent transitions - suggesting non pathological posterior topologies. 8.4 SensitivityAnalysis8.4.1 Forecasting on log-linear scale to assess signal in the dataAs we have highlighted throughout in this report, the lag between deaths and infections means thatit ta kes time for information to propagate backwa rds from deaths to infections, and ultimately to Rt. A conclusion of this report is the prediction of a slowing of Rt in response to major interventions. Togain intuition that this is data driven and not simply a consequence of highly constrained modelassumptions, we show death forecasts on a log-linear scale. On this scale a line which curves below alinear trend is indicative of slowing in the growth of the epidemic. Figure 10 to Figure 12 show theseforecasts for Italy, Spain and the UK. They show this slowing down in the daily number of deaths. Ourmodel suggests that Italy, a country that has the highest death toll of COVID-19, will see a slowing inthe increase in daily deaths over the coming week compared to the early stages of the epidemic. We investigated the sensitivity of our estimates of starting and final Rt to our assumed serial intervaldistribution. For this we considered several scenarios, in which we changed the serial intervaldistribution mean, from a value of 6.5 days, to have values of 5, 6, 7 and 8 days. In Figure 13, we show our estimates of R0, the starting reproduction number before interventions, foreach of these scenarios. The relative ordering of the Rt=0 in the countries is consistent in all settings. However, as expected, the scale of Rt=0 is considerably affected by this change — a longer serialinterval results in a higher estimated Rt=0. This is because to reach the currently observed size of theepidemics, a longer assumed serial interval is compensated by a higher estimated R0. Additionally, in Figure 14, we show our estimates of Rt at the most recent model time point, again foreach ofthese scenarios. The serial interval mean can influence Rt substantially, however, the posteriorcredible intervals of Rt are broadly overlapping. Figure 13: Initial reproduction number R0 for different serial interval (SI) distributions (meansbetween 5 and 8 days). We use 6.5 days in our main analysis. Figure 14: Rt on 28 March 2020 estimated for all countries, with serial interval (SI) distribution meansbetween 5 and 8 days. We use 6.5 days in our main analysis. 8.4.3 Uninformative prior sensitivity on orWe ran our model using implausible uninformative prior distributions on the intervention effects,allowing the effect of an intervention to increase or decrease Rt. To avoid collinearity, we ran 6separate models, with effects summarized below (compare with the main analysis in Figure 4). In thisseries of univariate analyses, we find (Figure 15) that all effects on their own serve to decrease Rt. This gives us confidence that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in themain analysis. Lockdown has a very large effect, most likely due to the fact that it occurs after otherinterventions in our dataset. The relatively large effect sizes for the other interventions are most likelydue to the coincidence of the interventions in time, such that one intervention is a proxy for a fewothers. Figure 15: Effects of different interventions when used as the only covariate in the model. 8.4.4To assess prior assumptions on our piecewise constant functional form for Rt we test using anonparametric function with a Gaussian process prior distribution. We fit a model with a Gaussianprocess prior distribution to data from Italy where there is the largest signal in death data. We findthat the Gaussian process has a very similartrend to the piecewise constant model and reverts to themean in regions of no data. The correspondence of a completely nonparametric function and ourpiecewise constant function suggests a suitable parametric specification of Rt. Nonparametric fitting of Rf using a Gaussian process:8.4.5 Leave country out analysisDue to the different lengths of each European countries’ epidemic, some countries, such as Italy havemuch more data than others (such as the UK). To ensure that we are not leveraging too muchinformation from any one country we perform a ”leave one country out” sensitivity analysis, wherewe rerun the model without a different country each time. Figure 16 and Figure 17 are examples forresults for the UK, leaving out Italy and Spain. In general, for all countries, we observed no significantdependence on any one country. Figure 16: Model results for the UK, when not using data from Italy for fitting the model. See theFigure 17: Model results for the UK, when not using data from Spain for fitting the model. See captionof Figure 2 for an explanation of the plots. 8.4.6 Starting reproduction numbers vs theoretical predictionsTo validate our starting reproduction numbers, we compare our fitted values to those theoreticallyexpected from a simpler model assuming exponential growth rate, and a serial interval distributionmean. We fit a linear model with a Poisson likelihood and log link function and extracting the dailygrowth rate r. For well-known theoretical results from the renewal equation, given a serial intervaldistribution g(r) with mean m and standard deviation 5, given a = mZ/S2 and b = m/SZ, andasubsequently R0 = (1 + %) .Figure 18 shows theoretically derived R0 along with our fittedestimates of Rt=0 from our Bayesian hierarchical model. As shown in Figure 18 there is largecorrespondence between our estimated starting reproduction number and the basic reproductionnumber implied by the growth rate r.R0 (red) vs R(FO) (black)Figure 18: Our estimated R0 (black) versus theoretically derived Ru(red) from a log-linearregression fit. 8.5 Counterfactual analysis — interventions vs no interventionsFigure 19: Daily number of confirmed deaths, predictions (up to 28 March) and forecasts (after) forall countries except Italy and Spain from our model with interventions (blue) and from the nointerventions counterfactual model (pink); credible intervals are shown one week into the future.

It contains a transactivation domain at the N-terminus and a DNA-binding domain at the C-terminus which consists of three zinc fingers (ZF). Sp1-ZF binds to GC-rich boxes with the consensus sequence 5'-G/T-GGGCGG-G/A [2]. The Sp1-ZF domain contains three contiguous classic Cys2-His2 motifs with the consensus sequence Cys-X2–4-Cys-X11–12-His-X3-His. Each Cys2-His2 ZF is organized by two β-sheets and an α-helix on which two Cys and two His residues are respectively located and are coordinately bound by one Zn+2 in the tetrahedral geometry. This geometry orients the fingers for site-specific recognition of GC boxes on targeted DNA [3].</p><p>Several metal ions can affect Sp1's transcriptional activities through interfering Sp1 ZF-DNA interactions. Sp1 regulates the expression of transporters for these metal ions, making Sp1 an important cellular regulator of metal ion homeostasis. We previously demonstrated that cadmium Cd(II) suppressed Sp1's transcription activity that regulates Cd transporter, Zip8, expression [4].</p><p>Sp1 plays a critical role in regulating copper (Cu) homeostasis. Cu is an essential micronutrient but is toxic when in excess, therefore, cellular bioavailable Cu has to be properly regulated We previously demonstrated that under Cu deficiency, Sp1 expression is transcriptionally self-upregulated by binding to its own promoter where 10 copies of GC-boxes are located [5]. Elevated Sp1 then transcriptionally upregulates expression of the high-affinity human copper transporter 1 (hCtr1) to transport Cu from the extracellular milieu. When cellular Cu levels reach the upper limit, Sp1 expression is silenced, thereby downregulating hCtr1 to prevent Cu overload [6, 7].</p><p>Importantly, hCtr1 can also transport cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), cDDP), a well-recognized antitumor agent in cancer chemotherapy [8]. cDDP functions as a competitor for hCtr1-mediated Cu(I) transport, causing reduced cellular Cu levels, resulting in increased Sp1 and hCtr1 expression [9]. These results demonstrated that Sp1 can transcriptionally up- and down-regulate Sp1 and hCtr1 in response to Cu deficiency and affluence, respectively. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown.</p><p>An important rate-limiting step in Sp1-mediated transcriptional regulation involves Sp1 binding to GC box sequences at the promoters of target genes. In this communication, we employed a gel electrophoretic mobility shift (GEMS) approach to investigate the effects of Cu(II) concentrations (replete and deplete conditions) and cDDP on the stability of Sp1-DNA binding. GEMS assay used 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probe containing a Sp1-binding sequence. We chose the GC-box sequence (Fig. 1A) located at site 10 of the Sp1 promoter which was responsive to Cu concentration-dependent Sp1 expression [5]. The probe was mixed with a nuclear extract prepared from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and nonspecific competitor poly(deoxyinosine-deoxycytidine) (poly(dI-dC)). The mixture was separated by gel electrophoresis as previously described [4]. We identified Sp1-DNA complex formation using the non-radioactively labeled wild-type GC-box oligonucleotides vs. mutant oligonucleotides as competitors (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 – 5). The Sp1-DNA complex was then confirmed using anti-Sp1 antibody in a super-shift assay (Fig. 1B, lane 6). We then included various concentrations of Cu+2, Zn+2, bathocuproine sulfonate (BCS, a Cu chelator), or Cd+2 in the reaction mixture to determine their effects on the stability of the Sp1-DNA complex. We found that at the concentration at which Cu+2 ions caused destabilization of the Sp1-DNA complex (Fig 1C [a], arrow head), no destabilization of the complex was found with Zn+2 ions at the same concentration (Fig, 1C [b]), although higher concentration of Zn+2 caused destabilization (Fig. 1C [b] lane 6). These results suggest that Cu+2 was more effective in reducing Sp1-DNA stability than Zn+2.</p><p>Interestingly, including BCS in the reaction mixture increased Sp1-DNA complex stabilization (Fig. 1C [c]). Because it has been demonstrated that BCS treatment does not change the available cellular Zn2+ pool [10], these results demonstrated that Cu chelation enhances Sp1-DNA stability. On the other hand, Cd(II), like Cu(II), induced destabilization of Sp1-DNA complex (Fig. 1C [d]).</p><p>To investigate the generality of these observations, we performed similar experiments using nuclear extracts prepared from HEK293 embryonic kidney cells and a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe from the sequence located at Site 8 at the Sp1 promoter [5] (Fig. 2A). In this experiment, we identified both Sp1-DNA and Sp3-DNA complexes by GMES using anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies in super-shift assay (Fig. 2B). We found that including CuSO4 in the reaction mixture destabilized both Sp1-DNA and Sp3-DNA complexes, whereas cDDP or BCS enhanced stabilization of both complexes (Figs. 2C & 2D). Given the fact that we previously found that cDDP and BCS can also coordinately upregulate of Sp1 and hCtr1 in an animal tumor model [6], we believe that these results are likely to be applicable to in vivo situations.</p><p>Our in vitro GEMS assays have the following important implications for the mechanistic regulation of Cu homeostasis and platinum drug transport: (i) We found that BCS and cDDP enhanced Sp1-DNA binding stability, consistent with their ability in inducing Sp1/hCtr1 transcriptional activities (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Cu(II) destabilizes Sp1-DNA interaction, also consistent with its suppressive effect on Sp1 regulated Sp1/hCtr1 expression (Fig. 3B). Thus, mechanisms by which these agents can transcriptionally upregulate and downregulate Sp1/hCtr1 expression can be explained by their effects on the stability of Sp1 binding to their respective promoters. The negative effect of Cu on Sp1-DNA stability may be explained by the displacement of Zn(II) in the geometry in the Sp1-ZF domain by Cu(II). Although Sp1-DNA complex formation primarily relies on DNA base and Sp1-ZF contact, interactions between His ligands and DNA phosphate backbone are also important [3]. Cu(II) may also neutralize negative changes on the DNA phosphate backbone, thus destabilizing its interactions with the His ligands of ZF.</p><p>The observation that Cu chelation induces Sp1-DNA stabilization thereby increased hCtr1 expression is intriguing. This approach has been taken to clinical trial using copper chelator in combination of Pt-based drug to improve the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy by enhanced Pt drug transport [7, 11]. While the precise mechanism for enhanced Sp1-DNA stability by Cu chelation remains to be critically elucidated, we speculate that this may be due to enhanced interaction between DNA phosphate groups and His ligands under reduced Cu(II) conditions. Further studies are needed to clarify this possibility.</p><p>Another important finding in this communication is that it appears the \\"free Cu(II) ions\\" are sufficient for regulating Sp1-DNA interaction. It has been suggested that virtually all cellular Cu is tightly bound, and intracellular Cu trafficking is carried out by Cu chaperones to different cellular compartments, i.e, CCS to superoxide dismutase in the cytoplasm [12], Cox17 to mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase, and Atox1 to two trans-Golgi P1B-type ATPases (ATP7A and ATP7B) [13]. It has been reported that ZF domain is involved in nuclear targeting of Sp1 [14]. However, our results from a cell-free system demonstrating that free Cu can affect Sp1-DNA binding suggest that regulation of Sp1-mediated transcriptional regulation by Cu may not need a carrier protein. Lastly, while hCtr1 transports Cu(I) but not Cu(II), our current results demonstrate that free Cu(II) can affect Sp1-DNA stability. Cu(I) can be converted to Cu(II) by Fenton reaction under oxidative stress conditions, whereas Cu(II) can be converted back to Cu(I) by metal reductase [7], suggesting that cellular Cu(I) and Cu(II) are interconvertable.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first demonstration describing the effects of Cu, Cu chelator, and cDDP on Sp1-DNA stability. The results mirror the effects of these agents on Sp1-regulation of Sp1 and hCtr1 expression. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of Cu homeostasis regulation and hCtr1-regulated platinum drug transport.</p><p>This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

Because Cu deficiency is lethal yet Cu overload is poisonous, hCtr1 expression is transcriptionally upregulated in response to Cu deficiency but is downregulated under Cu replete conditions in controlling Cu homeostasis. The up- and down-regulation of hCtr1 is regulated by Specific protein 1 (Sp1), which itself is also correspondingly regulated under these Cu conditions. hCtr1 expression is also upregulated by cDDP via upregulation of Sp1. The underlying mechanisms of these regulations are unknown. Using gel-electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated here that Sp1-DNA binding affinity is reduced under Cu replete conditions but increased under reduced Cu conditions. Similarly, Sp1-DNA binding affinity is increased by cDDP treatment. This in vitro system demonstrated, for the first time, that regulation of Sp1/hCtr1 expression by these agents is modulated by the stability of Sp1-DNA binding, the first step in the Sp1-mediated transcriptional regulation process."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

CONTEXT: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), common in southern China and North Africa, has a complex etiology involving interplay between viral, environmental, and hereditary factors and is almost constantly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Since the prognosis of locally advanced and metastatic diseases is poor, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of NPC would be important for discovering novel markers for patients' management. OBJECTIVES: To compare the proteomic expression profile between an Epstein-Barr virus-associated NPC cell line (C666-1) and a normal NP cell line (NP69). The proteins with differential expression were analyzed in 40 undifferentiated NPC paraffin-embedded specimens. DESIGN: Differentially expressed proteins discovered between the two cell lines were identified by mass spectrometry. After confirmation by immunocytochemical staining, their expression in patient samples was measured using 40 pairs of undifferentiated NPCs together with their adjacent normal epithelia. RESULTS: Proteomic findings indicated that adenosine triphosphate synthase alpha chain was up-regulated, whereas annexin II, annexin V, beta(2)-tubulin, and profilin 1 were down-regulated. After confirming the results in agar-processed cell lines, annexin II and beta(2)-tubulin expression were found to be lower in tumor cells than in adjacent normal epithelial cells in 100% and 90% of the patients' specimens, respectively. Finally, annexin II down-regulation was positively associated with lymph node metastasis, suggesting that it may be a prognostic factor in NPC. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that annexin II and beta(2)-tubulin down-regulation is important in NPC formation and may represent potential targets for further investigations.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"NPC\\", \\"tumor cells\\", \\"NP69\\", \\"epithelia\\", \\"lymph node\\", \\"nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines C666-1\\", \\"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma\\", \\"NP cell line\\", \\"samples\\", \\"cell lines\\", \\"specimens\\", \\"nasopharyngeal carcinoma\\", \\"C666-1\\", \\"NPC cell line\\", \\"metastatic diseases\\", \\"NPCs\\", \\"epithelial cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The immunosuppressants ciclosporin and FK506 block the Ca (2 +) -dependent signal-transduction pathway emanating from the T-cell receptor, thereby inhibiting the activation of helper T cells. Using these drugs as probes, chemists and biologists have uncovered several intracellular signalling molecules bridging the generation of second-messenger Ca2 + ions and the transcriptional activation of IL-2, among which are calmodulin, calcineurin and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). Hence, Ca2 + binds to calmodulin, leading to the binding of calmodulin to calcineurin; the activated calcineurin, in turn, may dephosphorylate the cytoplasmic subunit of NF-AT, resulting in its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form a competent transcriptional activator. As described by Jun Liu, these drugs manifest their effects in an unprecedented fashion. They do not directly intercept intracellular signalling molecules. Instead, they form tight complexes with two different classes of abundant cytosolic receptors called immunophilins upon entering the cell, and consequently inhibit their peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activities. The two structurally distinct immunophilin-drug complexes bind to, and inhibit, the phosphatase activity of calcineurin.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"helper T cells\\", \\"activated T cells\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"phosphatase\\", \\"cytoplasmic subunit of NF - AT\\", \\"immunophilin - drug complexes\\", \\"T - cell receptor\\", \\"calcineurin\\", \\"peptidyl prolyl cis - trans isomerase\\", \\"calmodulin\\", \\"nuclear factor of activated T cells\\", \\"cytosolic receptors\\", \\"immunophilins\\", \\"Jun\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"competent transcriptional activator\\", \\"NF - AT\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Differences in cure rates among the three procedures at the 3-month postoperative evaluation were insignificant (82%, 84%, and 92% for the anterior colporrhaphy, Pereyra, and Burch respectively) but became statistically significant at the 1 year postoperative evaluation (cure rates of 65%, 72%, and 91% for the anterior colporrhaphy, Pereyra, and Burch respectively, p less than 0.05). In our hands the Burch procedure stabilized the urethrovesical junction and prevented its descent during straining (evaluated by a postoperative Q-tip test) more effectively than either the Pereyra or anterior colporrhaphy. No procedure resulted in severe postoperative voiding difficulties. The present prospective randomized study demonstrates that in our hands the abdominal retropubic operation for genuine stress incontinence in patients not previously operated on results in a higher cure rate when compared with anterior colporrhaphy or Pereyra procedure.Title 2:Urodynamics in women with stress incontinence before and after surgery.Abstract 2:Pad test, cystometry and analysis of micturition were performed in 36 women with stress incontinence before and a year after operation with either retropubic urethrocystopexy (n = 22) or pubococcygeal repair (n = 14). There was no difference in the subjective cure rate between the two groups of women (77% and 79%, respectively). The pad test 1 year after operation showed that 59% of the women in the urethrocystopexy group and 43% of the women in the pubococcygeal repair group had stopped leaking urine. The bladder volume had increased in both groups and the intravesical pressure of the bladder filled to the maximum had increased in the pubococcygeal repair group. The functional length of the urethra, intravesical pressure at maximal urine flow, maximal urine flow rate and urethral conductance were not affected by either operation. Pad test was a more accurate test for an objective evaluation of urine leakage before operation than were the urodynamic investigation or continence tests.Title 3:Primary stress urinary incontinence and pelvic relaxation: prospective randomized comparison of three different operations.Abstract 3:There were 289 women with clinical and urodynamic diagnosis of primary stress urinary incontinence, stable bladder, and pelvic relaxation who underwent a single-stage surgical procedure because of incontinence and pelvic relaxation. Patients underwent one of three surgical procedures because of stress incontinence--anterior colporrhaphy, revised Pereyra procedure, or Burch retropubic urethropexy. Decisions with regard to the type of bladder neck suspension and the surgeon were made randomly with a randomization table. Each patient had a complete clinical and urodynamic evaluation before surgery and at 3 and 12 months after surgery. Cure rate as defined by strict clinical and urodynamic criteria was not significantly different among the three groups at the 3-month postsurgical evaluations; however, at the 12-month postsurgical evaluations, the cure rate among women who underwent Burch urethropexy (n = 101) was significantly higher than that of either Pereyra or anterior colporrhaphy (cure rates were 87%, 70%, and 69%, respectively; p less than 0.01). The Burch urethropexy was more effective than the Pereyra procedure or anterior colporrhaphy in the stabilization of the bladder base and resulted in a significantly better cure rate in women with primary stress urinary incontinence and pelvic relaxation.Title 4:A randomized trial of burch retropubic urethropexy and anterior colporrhaphy for stress urinary incontinence.Abstract 4:In a randomized trial, we compared the success of Burch retropubic urethropexy to the modified anterior colporrhaphy for the treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence.                Thirty-five patients with stress incontinence were randomly assigned to undergo Burch retropubic urethropexy or modified anterior colporrhaphy. Subjects had preoperative and 1-year postoperative physical examinations, multichannel urodynamic testing, 20-minute pad test, and subjective grading of incontinence severity with questionnaires. Data were evaluated using Fisher exact test, Wilcoxon two-sample test, logistic regression analysis, and analysis of variance.                Objective cure 1 year postoperatively was significantly greater for the women treated by Burch retropubic urethropexy than by modified anterior colporrhaphy (16 of 18 [89%] versus five of 16 [31%], relative risk .15, 95% confidence interval .04, .59). Patients' subjective ratings of incontinence severity 1 year after surgical treatment were significantly lower in women who had Burch retropubic urethropexy.                Burch retropubic urethropexy yields a significantly superior objective cure for genuine stress urinary incontinence than the modified anterior colporrhaphy in a randomized trial.Title 5:Randomised comparison of Burch colposuspension versus anterior colporrhaphy in women with stress urinary incontinence and anterior vaginal wall prolapse.Abstract 5:To compare the Burch colposuspension and the anterior colporrhaphy in women with both stress urinary incontinence and advanced anterior vaginal wall prolapse (cystocele).                Prospective randomised study.                Secondary referral centre, Urogynaecology Unit, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.                Seventy-one women undergoing surgery for primary genuine stress incontinence and concurrent grade 2 or 3 cystocele (descending at or outside the vaginal introitus).                Full urodynamic investigation performed pre-operatively and repeated six months after surgery. Clinical follow up continued for 8 to 17 years.                Subjective (patient history) and objective (negative stress test result) cure of stress incontinence. Assessment of cystocele recurrence.                Thirty (86%) of the 35 evaluable women who had the Burch colposuspension and 17 (52%) of the 33 evaluable women who had the anterior colporrhaphy were subjectively cured (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 21.6; P = 0.005). Objective cure rates were 74% (26 of 35) and 42% (14 of 33), respectively (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 12.5; P = 0.02). A recurrent cystocele of grade 2 or 3 with or without prolapse at other vaginal sites was recorded in 34% (12 of 35) and 3% (1 of 33) of women, respectively (OR 16.7, 95% CI 2.0 to 368.1; P = 0.003).                The Burch colposuspension was better in controlling stress incontinence but it lead to an unacceptable high rate of prolapse recurrence. The anterior colporrhaphy was more effective in restoring vaginal anatomy but it was accompanied by an unacceptable low cure rate of stress incontinence. Neither of the two operations is recommended for women who are suffering from a combination of stress incontinence and advanced cystocele.Title 6:Pelvic floor exercise versus surgery for female urinary stress incontinence.Abstract 6:Fifty consecutive female patients with genuine urinary stress incontinence were randomized either to surgery or to a pelvic floor training program. The operative procedure was chosen according to the type of bladder suspension defect on micturition cystourethrography. The training program was given 5 times in weekly lessons and the patients were guided by trained physiotherapists. Surgery was superior to the pelvic floor training program both subjectively and objectively. However, a significant improvement was found following the training program. Forty-two percent were satisfied with the outcome of the training and did not want operation. We find physiotherapist-guided pelvic floor exercise a realistic alternative to surgery in patients with mild degrees of stress incontinence. Also patients with residual symptoms after surgery are candidates for pelvic floor training.","answer":"There were not enough data to allow comparison of anterior vaginal repair with physical therapy or needle suspension for primary urinary stress incontinence in women. Open abdominal retropubic suspension appeared to be better than anterior vaginal repair judged on subjective cure rates in eight trials, even in women who had prolapse in addition to stress incontinence (six trials). The need for repeat incontinence surgery was also less after the abdominal operation. However, there was not enough information about post-operative complications and morbidity."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

Rigorous quality assurance ( QA ) processes were undertaken to ensure the validity and reliability of the radiation therapy treatment plan data . METHOD QA processes included a planning benchmarking exercise and a periodic audit of target and normal tissue delineation . Central ised electronic review of digital plan data for external-beam radiotherapy was undertaken to detect protocol variations . The impact of clinical factors and feedback to su bmi tting centres during the trial on variation rates was investigated . RESULTS Twenty-three centres across Australia and New Zeal and recruited 1071 participants to the trial . Treatment plans for 754 participants receiving external-beam treatment alone  were review ed . From these , 1185 minor and 86 major variations were identified , leading to feedback to treating centres to reduce variations for subsequent patients ' treatment and plans , suggesting improvement in treatment quality through these QA programs . Participant anatomical factors ( delineated clinical target volume and rectal volume ) and treatment planning factors ( beam energy , beam definition and patient position orientation ) were found to significantly impact variation rates . The dummy run demonstrated disagreement in identification of the base of the prostate and the superior extent of the rectum . Feedback from the periodic audit led to a change of practice at five contributing centres . CONCLUSION The application of a suite of complementary QA activities allows the quality of trial data to be optimised and quantified , and can provide a catalyst for reforming treatment practiceTitle 2:QA makes a clinical trial stronger: evidence-based medicine in radiation therapy.Abstract 2:Quality assurance ( QA ) for radiation therapy  ( RT ) in clinical trials is necessary to ensure treatment is safely and effectively administered . QA assurance requires however substantial human and financial re sources , as it has become more comprehensive and labor intensive in recent RT trials . It is presumed that RT deviations decrease therapeutic effectiveness of the studied regimen . This study assesses the impact of RT protocol -deviations on patient 's outcome in prospect i ve phase II-III RT trials . PubMed , Medline and Embase identified nine prospect i ve RT trials detailing QA RT violation and patient 's outcome . Planned QA analysis was preformed retrospectively and prospect ively in eight and one studies , respectively . Non-adherence to protocol -specified RT requirements in prospect i ve trials is frequent : the observed major deviation rates range from 11.8 % to 48.0 % ( mean , 28.1 ± 17.9 % ) . QA RT deviations had a significant impact on the primary study end-point in a majority ( 62.5 % ) of studies . The number of patients accrued per center was a significant predictive factor for RT deviations in the largest series . These QA data stemming from prospect i ve clinical trials show undisputedly that non adherence to protocol -specified RT requirements is associated with reduced survival , local control and potentially increased toxicityTitle 3:Failure to adhere to protocol specified radiation therapy guidelines was associated with decreased survival in RTOG 9704--a phase III trial of adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy for patients with resected adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.Abstract 3:PURPOSE In Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9704 , as previously published , patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma received continuous infusion 5-FU and concurrent radiotherapy ( 5FU-RT ) . 5FU-RT treatment was preceded and followed by r and omly assigned chemotherapy , either 5-FU or gemcitabine . This analysis explored whether failure to adhere to specified RT guidelines influenced survival and /or toxicity . METHODS AND MATERIAL S RT requirements were protocol specified . Adherence was scored as per protocol ( PP ) or less than per protocol ( < PP ) . Scoring occurred after therapy but before trial analysis and without knowledge of individual patient treatment outcomes . Scoring was done for all tumor locations and for the subset of pancreatic head location . RESULTS RT was scored for 416 patients : 216 PP and 200 < PP . For all pancreatic sites ( head , body/tail ) median survival ( MS ) for PP vs. < PP was 1.74 vs. 1.46 years ( log-rank p = 0.0077 ) . In multivariate analysis , PP vs. < PP score correlated more strongly with MS than assigned treatment arm ( p = 0.014 , p = NS , respectively ) ; for patients with pancreatic head tumors , both PP score and gemcitabine treatment correlated with improved MS ( p = 0.016 , p = 0.043 , respectively ) . For all tumor locations , PP score was associated with decreased risk of failure ( p = 0.016 ) and , for gemcitabine patients , a trend toward reduced Grade 4/5 nonhematologic toxicity ( p = 0.065 ) . CONCLUSIONS This is the first Phase III , multicenter , adjuvant protocol for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to evaluate the impact of adherence to specified RT protocol guidelines on protocol outcomes . Failure to adhere to specified RT guidelines was associated with reduced survival and , for patients receiving gemcitabine , trend toward increased nonhematologic toxicityTitle 4:Tirapazamine, cisplatin, and radiation versus cisplatin and radiation for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (TROG 02.02, HeadSTART): a phase III trial of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group.Abstract 4:PURPOSE Promising results in a r and omized phase II trial with the hypoxic cytotoxin tirapazamine ( TPZ ) combined with cisplatin ( CIS ) and radiation led to this phase III trial . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with previously untreated stage III or IV ( excluding T1 - 2N1 and M1 ) squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , or larynx were r and omly assigned to receive definitive radiotherapy ( 70 Gy in 7 weeks ) concurrently with either CIS ( 100 mg/m(2 ) ) on day 1 of weeks 1 , 4 , and 7 or CIS ( 75 mg/m(2 ) ) plus TPZ ( 290 mg/m(2)/d ) on day 1 of weeks 1 , 4 , and 7 and TPZ alone ( 160 mg/m(2)/d ) on days 1 , 3 , and 5 of weeks 2 and 3 ( TPZ/CIS ) . The primary end point was overall survival ( OS ) . The planned sample size was 850 , estimated to result in 334 deaths , which would provide 90 % power to detect a difference in 2-year survival rates of 60 % v 70 % for CIS versus TPZ/CIS , respectively ( hazard ratio = 0.69 ) . RESULTS Eight hundred sixty-one patients were accrued from 89 sites in 16 countries . In an intent-to-treat analysis , the 2-year OS rates were 65.7 % for CIS and 66.2 % for TPZ/CIS ( TPZ/CIS -- CIS : 95 % CI , -5.9 % to 6.9 % ) . There were no significant differences in failure-free survival , time to locoregional failure , or quality of life as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck . CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence that the addition of TPZ to chemoradiotherapy , in patients with advanced head and neck cancer not selected for the presence of hypoxia , improves OSTitle 5:Quality assurance of the EORTC trial 22911. A phase III study of post-operative external radiotherapy in pathological stage T3N0 prostatic carcinoma: the dummy run.Abstract 5:INTRODUCTION A dry run of a clinical trial ( EORTC 22911 ) is presented in which 12 centres have participated . These are the centres which have contributed the largest number of patients to the trial . MATERIAL AND METHODS Each participating centre received data from a suitable patient . Investigators were asked to plan and ' treat ' the patient according to the protocol guidelines and return the data for evaluation of compliance . RESULTS The results show that compliance to the protocol guidelines was generally good . There were a few minor deviations in the dose and fractionation schedule , in the volume reduction for the booster dose and in the dose prescription point . None of these deviations will affect the outcome of the study . The most important observation is the large inter-centre variation in target volumes . CONCLUSIONS The results of this study underlines the need for a strict definition of the target volume and the adoption of the ICRU 50 recommendations in future protocolTitle 6:EORTC Radiation Oncology Group quality assurance platform: establishment of a digital central review facility.Abstract 6:OBJECTIVE Quality assurance ( QA ) in clinical trials is essential to ensure treatment is safely and effectively delivered .

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Abstract In this paper, a probabilistic target vehicle tracking method is proposed for situation awareness of intelligent cruise control (ICC) vehicle. The ICC vehicle considered herein is equipped with a 24 GHz microwave radar for tracking the preceding vehicle. To overcome the severe dispersion and noise of the microwave radar, a statistical model for the radar is built and it is applied to the hybrid particle filter. The hybrid particle filter is combined with the interacting multiple models (IMM) to track the preceding vehicle and predict the driver's intention. Furthermore, the modified hybrid particle filter is proposed to cope with the missing or multiple measurements of the microwave radar. Finally, a computer simulation is conducted and the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Track-to-track fusion is an important topic for distributed tracking. Compared with the centralized measurement fusion, the track-to-track fusion requires less communication resources and is suitable for practical implementation. Although having been widely investigated in the literature, the majority of track-to-track fusion algorithms assume synchronous communication. However, in practice, local sensors might communicate to the fusion center with arbitrary communication intervals, which raises the problem of multi-sensor asynchronous track-to-track fusion. In this paper we develop an exact fusion algorithm to solve this problem, under the condition that at each time step only parts of the sensors send their local estimation tracks to the fusion center. Formulas are derived to obtain the exact cross-covariances between the local tracks by taking into consideration the impact of the potential feedback from the fusion center. Based on the derived formulas, the scalable fusion algorithm is developed and validated with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  In recent years, as demands for the vehicle safety and autonomous driving of the automobile industry have increased, it becomes important to more accurately recognize the position and velocity of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, heuristic fusion with adaptive gating and track to track fusion are applied to track fusion of camera and radar sensor for forward vehicle tracking system and the two algorithms are compared. To compare the two algorithms, simulation was carried out in 10 scenarios and the accuracy of sensor fusion results was measured with optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) metric. The results of this metric are compared to show that the track to track fusion is superior to the adaptive gating for the target estimation. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Tracking and behavior reasoning of surrounding vehicles on a roadway are keys for the development of automated vehicles and an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). Based on dynamic information of the surrounding vehicles from the tracking algorithm and driver intentions from the behavior reasoning algorithm, the automated vehicles and ADAS can predict possible collisions and generate safe motion to avoid accidents. This paper presents a unified vehicle tracking and behavior reasoning algorithm that can simultaneously estimate the vehicle dynamic state and driver intentions. The multiple model filter based on various behavior models was used to classify the vehicle behavior and estimate the dynamic state of surrounding vehicles. In addition, roadway geometry constraints were applied to the unified vehicle tracking and behavior reasoning algorithm in order to improve the dynamic state estimation and the behavior classification performance. The curvilinear coordinate system was constructed based on the precise map information in order to apply the roadway geometry to the tracking and behavior reasoning algorithm. The proposed algorithm was verified and evaluated through experiments under various test scenarios. From the experimental results, we concluded that the presented tracking and behavior reasoning algorithm based on the roadway geometry constraints provides sufficient accuracy and reliability for automated vehicles and ADAS applications.Literature Review:","answer":"The Bayesian tracking method mainly tracks multi-targets with multi-modes of probability density (PD) and approximates each mode with component PD. Particle filter (PF), a modified Bayesian algorithm, can effectively cope with the nonlinear and non-Gaussian Bayesian estimation problem, which is suitable for solving the component PD estimation problem. When the Bayesian algorithm is applied for multi-target tracking to recursively estimate the state of multiple targets and determine the current target number, the sequence maximum-likelihood (ML) ratio is generally applied to verify whether the target is existed or disappeared. According to the test results (the appearance or disappearance of targets), the mixed components representing multiple targets can be determined to add or delete, so that the multi-modal posterior PD can be updated and maintained. Reference BIB001 established the relationship model between target kinematics and class by adopting a Bayesian network. The Bayesian method and D-S method widely applied in recognition and sensor fusion. D-S method overcomes the problem that the Bayesian method cannot express incomplete or uncertain evidence. PF is a specific form of Bayesian filter, and the performance of PF elaborated in reference BIB004 for tracking vehicle targets in detail. The improved particle filter is proved to be superior to KF through practical tests. The front car tracking and prediction of the driver's intention algorithm are proposed in reference BIB002 combined with hybrid PF and IMM (IMM-PF). Then an improved PF algorithm is proposed to track vehicle targets to solve the problem of data correlation. The results show that the performance of the improved PF increased in an extreme situation. Reference BIB003 further proposed the multi-sensor track fusion algorithm, which adopted the ML fusion rule to deal with the correlation between the measurement of multiple sensors and multiple targets. The covariance matrix is applied to represent the correlation between multiple measurements updated by a fusion center decision. Moreover, compared with the naive algorithm and centralized KF, the experimental result demonstrates that the proposed Bayesian algorithm can reduce the mean square error (MSE). In reference BIB005 , the Bayesian filtering is applied to complete multi-target tracking and introduce the road constraints into the algorithm. Due to the limitations of sensors and environment, such as short detection range, narrow field of vision, signal noise, and unexpected occupied obstacles, which lead performance constraints, the road geometry information is applied to the tracking algorithm to overcome the tracking constraints based on the vehicle sensors. With the continuous improvement of traffic facilities in the future, the structural features of roads will be more and more prominent. The introduction of structured constraints can improve algorithm performance and simplify the target motion model."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The human interleukin-3 (IL-3) gene is expressed almost exclusively in activated T cells. Its expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. We have previously shown that treatment of Jurkat T cells with phytohemaglutinin (PHA) and the phorbol ester, PMA, activated transcription initiation from the IL-3 gene. To define the regions of the gene required for transcription activation, we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different regions of the IL-3 gene 5' and 3' flanking sequences. Both positive and negative regulatory elements were identified in the proximal 5' flanking region of the IL-3 gene. The promoter region between-173 and-60 contained the strongest activating elements. The transcription factor AP-1 could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter. We also examined the function of the IL-3 CK-1 / CK-2 elements that are present in many cytokine genes and found that they acted as a repressor of basal level expression when cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter but were also inducible by PMA / PHA.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"Jurkat T cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"heterologous promoter\\", \\"T - cell functional regions\\", \\"IL - 3 gene 5u0027 and 3u0027 flanking sequences\\", \\"IL - 3 gene\\", \\"human IL - 3 proximal promoter\\", \\"positive and negative regulatory elements\\", \\"IL - 3 CK - 1 / CK - 2 elements\\", \\"cytokine genes\\", \\"promoter region\\", \\"activating elements\\", \\"- 173 and - 60\\", \\"human interleukin - 3 (IL - 3) gene\\", \\"proximal 5u0027 flanking region\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"/ PHA\\", \\"PHA\\", \\"AP - 1\\", \\"phytohemaglutinin\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"IL - 3\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  There are positional and geometric uncertainties in assembly operation. In order to perform an assembly operation by robot successfully, it is necessary to estimate the correct position and geometric information of a fixed environment. This paper describes a technique that can estimate the contact position and geometric information between the object and the environment from a number of positions and orientations of a moving object, which are measured while the object is dexterously slid and rotated on the environment around the contact position. It is assumed that the environment and object are polyhedra. There are three kinds of basic contact pairs when the two polyhedra are in contact with each other. Corresponding to these basic contact pairs, three kinds of estimation approaches are proposed. By these estimation approaches, the environment position and geometric information on contacting parts can be estimated successfully. Experimental verification on the proposed approaches is performed and its results are outlined. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  A new task-level adaptive controller is presented for the hybrid dynamic control of constrained motion systems. Using a hybrid dynamic model of the process, velocity constraints are derived from which satisfactory velocity commands are obtained. Due to modeling errors and parametric uncertainties, the velocity commands may be erroneous and may result in suboptimal performance. A task-level adaptive control scheme, based on the occurrence of discrete events, is used to change the model parameters from which the velocity commands are determined. Automated control of an assembly task is given as an example, and simulations and experiments for this task are presented. These results demonstrate the applicability of the method and also indicate properties for rapid convergence. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  This article describes a new statistical, model-based approach to building a contact-state observer for time-invariant con straints for a point in three dimensions. Three-dimensional constraint estimation and selection, and the application of these procedures to a planar, two-dimensional maze is described in detail. The observer uses measurements of the contact force and position, and prior information about the task encoded in a network, to determine the current location of the robot in the task-configuration space. Each node represents what the measurements will look like in a small region of configuration space by storing a predictive, statistical, measurement model. Construction of the task network requires a model of both the grasped part and the environment. The model makes the system robust to alignment errors, however, gross errors can occur if the topology of the modeled configuration space differs from the true topology. Arcs in the task network represent possible transitions between models. Bea... 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  This paper uses (linearized) Kalman filters to estimate first-order geometric parameters (i.e., orientation of contact normals and location of contact points) that occur in force-controlled compliant motions. The time variance of these parameters is also estimated. In addition, transitions between contact situations can be monitored. The contact between the manipulated object and its environment is general, i.e., multiple contacts can occur at the same time, and both the topology and the geometry of each single contact are arbitrary. The two major theoretical contributions are (1) the integration of the general contact model, developed previously by the authors, into a state-space form suitable for recursive processing; and (2) the use of the reciprocity constraint between ideal contact forces and motion freedoms as the measurement equation of the Kalman filter. The theory is illustrated by full 3-D experiments. The approach of this paper allows a breakthrough in the state of the art dominated by the classical, orthogonal contact models of Mason that can only cope with a limited (albeit important) subset of all possible contact situations. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  In this paper we present an approach to estimating the contact state between a robot and its environment during task execution. Contact states are modeled by constraint equations parametrized by timedependent sensor data and time-independent object properties. At each sampling time, multiple model estimation is used to assess the most likely contact state. The assessment is performed by a hidden Markov model, which combines a measure of how well each set of constraint equations fits the sensor data with the probability of specific contact state transitions. The latter is embodied in a task-based contact state network. The approach is illustrated for a three-dimensional peg-in-hole insertion using a tabletop manipulator robot. Using only position sensing, the contact state sequence is successfully estimated without knowledge of nominal property values. Property estimates are obtained for the peg dimensions as well as the hole position and orientation. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  This work presents new experimental results for the estimation of large position and orientation inaccuracies of contacting objects during force-controlled compliant motion. The estimation is based on position, velocity, and force measurements. The authors have described the contact modeling and presented some Kalman filter identification results for small inaccuracies. However, when dealing with larger inaccuracies, the nonlinear estimation problem remained unsolved. This problem has now been solved satisfactorily by applying a new Bayesian estimator. The Bayesian filter is valid for static systems (parameter estimation) with any kind of nonlinear measurement equation, subject to Gaussian measurement uncertainty and for a limited class of dynamic systems. Experimental results of this new filter are given for the estimation of the positions and orientations of contacting objects during the cube-in-corner assembly described in the first reference.Literature Review:","answer":"The geometrical parameters in a contact state are the positions and orientations of the vertices, edges, faces, etc., that are involved in the contact state. The more accurately these parameters are known in the contact model, the smaller errors will be generated by the robot controller. In most practical situations, the uncertainty on the geometrical parameters must be within certain bounds, because otherwise the controller will command motions that will either loose contact, or generate too high contact forces. The estimation of the contact location and orientation is often applied to the most simple contact state, i.e., the type of single vertex-surface contacts only. Only a few authors have considered more complex contact situations. Unless mentioned otherwise, the estimation techniques usually were deterministic and considered only the last measured data or the batch of all data. Ipri and Asada  estimated the instantaneous rotation center of a manipulated object making multiple contacts with the environment; Mimura and Funahashi BIB001 estimated the pose of the contacting features for vertex-face, edge-face and faceface contacts; Yoshikawa et al. BIB002 estimated the pose of a polyhedral environment object by touching it with a known manipulated object; McCarragher and Austin BIB003 estimated the contact normals at the different contacts between polyhedral objects based on a user-defined weighting between the previous estimate and the measurement; and Eberman BIB004 estimated the rotation of the constrained/free space of contacts for which the configuration space model was known. The most general contact cases between rigid objects with generally curved surfaces were considered by the research group of De Schutter and Bruyninckx [63 -66] and by Debus et al. BIB006 . The former research group modeled contacts by a Virtual Contact Manipulator, describing the relative degrees of freedom between the contacting objects in function of the geometrical parameters. Identification of the parameters was based on pose, wrench and twist measurements using different Bayesian estimation techniques BIB005 BIB007 . Debus et al., on the other hand, applied a deterministic non-linear least-squares estimation method based on a fixed-length moving data window. The estimates were calculated based on the penetration distance between the contacting objects using pose measurements."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

By screening a human genomic library with an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) cDNA probe, we have isolated a 15 kb clone which contains the entire coding region of the gene as expressed in monocytes, and includes 6 kb of 5'-upstream sequence. The gene contains four exons which code for the secreted form of the IL-1ra, however, our clone does not contain the alternative first exon used to generate an intracellular form of the protein as the protein as found in epithelial cells. Analysis of the sequence reveals a consensus TATA box, and three Alu repeats, two of which are in the upstream region and one in intron 3. The sequence also reveals an 86 bp motif tandomly repeated four times within intron 2, and may reflect the polymorphism known to exist in this region of the gene. By in-situ fluorescence hybridization we have shown that the IL-1ra gene is found on the long arm of chromosome 2 and maps to 2q13-14.1.

The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is associated with a high frequency of BRCA1 mutations. However, the widespread use of BRCA1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns  the fear of loss of health and life insurance, the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result, and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for BRCA1 mutations. We have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning, based on a combination of extensive multiplex PCR amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis. The efficiency of this system, as a screening test for BRCA1 mutations, was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women, 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in BRCA1. All 14 mutations were identified, as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection. In addition to the 19 mutations, a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored, most of which were recurring. All were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately US  70 for the manual technique used in this study, and may be reduced to approximately US  10 with the introduction of commercially available PCR robotics and fluorescent imaging. Implementation of this method of mutation screening in the research and clinical setting should permit rapid accrual of quantitative data on genotype-phenotype associations for the evaluation of diagnostic testing..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Bone marrow samples from 33 patients affected by MM and MGUS, and 8 patients not affected by lymphoproliferative diseases were studied for expression of c-Jun (a component of the transcription factor AP-1) and glutathione-S-transferase pi (GST-pi) using immunocytochemical methods. A high and frequent expression of these two proteins was found both in MM and MGUS patients (31 / 33 patients positive for c-Jun and 29 / 33 patients positive for GST-pi) and in controls not affected by monoclonal gammopathy (7 / 8 patients positive for both c-Jun and GST-pi). No statistically significant correlation was found between c-Jun-and GST-pi-positive plasma cells. The expression of these two proteins was not related to clinical or laboratory data.

However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with approximately 20 % of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the emergence of MERS. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the past three years, understanding of the interplay between camel, environment, and human remains limited. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12985-015-0439-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. Text: An email from Dr Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian virologist working at the Dr Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) announced the first culture of a new coronavirus to the world. The email was published on the website of the professional emerging diseases (ProMED) network on 20 th September 2012 [1] (Fig. 1) and described the first reported case, a 60 year old man from Bisha in the KSA. This information led to the rapid discovery of a second case of the virus, this time in an ill patient in the United Kingdom, who had been transferred from Qatar for care [2] . The new virus was initially called novel coronavirus (nCoV) and subsequentlty entitled the Middle East respiratoy syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). As of 2 nd of September 2015, there have been 1,493 detections of viral RNA or virus-specific antibodies across 26 countries (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ) confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with over a third of the positive people dying (at least 527, 35 %) [3] . Since that first report, a slow discovery process over the following two to three years revealed a virus that had infected over 90 % of adult dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) in the KSA [4] , also DCs across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa that are a source of DC imports for the KSA [5] . To date, MERS-CoV has not been detected in DCs tested in zoos or herds from other parts of the world [6] [7] [8] [9] . Occasionally, virus is transmitted from infected DCs to exposed humans. Subsequent transmission to other humans requires relatively close and prolonged exposure [10] . The first viral isolate was patented and concerns were raised that this would restrict access to both the virus and to viral diagnostics [11, 12] . However, sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics were quickly described and virus was made freely available subject to routine biosafety considerations [13] . Subsequent epidemiology and research has identified the cell receptor as exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26); that MERS-CoV has a broad tropism, replicating better in some cells lines and eliciting a more proinflammatory response than SARS-CoV; is widespread in DCs; has the potential to infect other animals and that MERS kills its human host more often than SARS did (20-40 % versus 9 % for SARS [14] ) [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In humans, overt disease was given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome, with the acronym MERS. From intermittent animal-to-human spill-over events, the MERS-CoV spreads sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older adults, especially males, with pre-existing diseases. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, with around 20 % of all cases to date involving healthcare workers (HCWs). Although DCs appear to suffer the equivalent of a 'common cold' from MERS-CoV infection, in humans, the virus can be a more serious and opportunistic pathogen associated with the death of up to 40 % of reported cases. It has yet to be established whether infections thought to have been acquired from an animal source produce a more severe outcome than those spread between humans [20] . Studies have established that the mean incubation period for MERS is five to six days, ranging from two to 16 days, with 13 to 14 days between when illness begins in one person and subsequently spreads to another [21] [22] [23] [24] . Among those with progressive illness, the median time to death is 11 to 13 days, ranging from five to 27 days [23, 24] . Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline, only to be followed by a more severe systemic and respiratory syndrome [25, 26] . The first WHO case definition [27] defined probable cases of MERS based on the presence of febrile illness, cough and requirement for hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract (LRT) involvement. It also included roles for contact with a probable or confirmed case or for travel or residence within the Arabian Peninsula. If strictly adhered to, only the severe syndrome would be subject to laboratory testing, which was the paradigm early on [21] . From July 2013, the revised WHO case definition included the importance of seeking out and understanding the role of asymptomatic cases and from June 2014, the WHO definition more clearly stated that a confirmed case included any person whose sample was RT-PCR positive for MERS-CoV, or who produced a seroconversion, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. [28] [29] [30] Apart from the WHO and the KSA Ministry of Health reports, asymptomatic or subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection were documented in the scientific literature although not always as often as occurred early on [31, 32] . The KSA definition of a case became more strict on 13 th May 2014, relying on the presence of both clinical features and laboratory confirmation [33] . Testing of asymptomatic people was recommended against from December 2014 [34] , reinforced by a case definition released by the KSA Ministry of Health in June 2015 [35] . The KSA has been the source of 79 % of human cases. Severe MERS is notable for its impact among older men with comorbid diseases including diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis and various lung, renal and cardiac conditions [36] [37] [38] . Interestingly in June 2015, an outbreak in South Korea followed a similar distribution [39, 40] . Among laboratory confirmed cases, fever, cough and upper respiratory tract (URT) signs and symptoms usually occur first, followed within a week by progressive LRT distress and lymphopaenia [37] . Patients often present to a hospital with  , or worse, and secondary bacterial infections have been reported [37, 41] . Disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure [37] . MERS has reportedly killed approximately 35 % of all reported cases, 42 % of cases in the KSA, yet only 19 % of cases in South Korea, where mortality ranged from 7 % among younger age groups to 40 % among those aged 60 years and above [42] ; all may be inflated values with asymptomatic or mild infections sometimes not sought or not reported [34] . General supportive care is key to managing severe cases [43] . Children under the age of 14 years are rarely reported to be positive for MERS-CoV, comprising only 1.1 % (n = 16) of total reported cases. Between 1 st September 2012 and 2 nd December 2013, a study described the then tally of paediatric cases in the KSA, which stood at 11 (two to 16 years of age; median 13 years); nine were asymptomatic (72 %) and one infant died [44] . In Amman, Jordan, 1,005 samples from hospitalized children under the age of two years with fever and/or respiratory signs and symptoms were tested but none were positive for MERS-CoV RNA, despite being collected at a similar time to the first known outbreak of MERS-CoV in the neighbouring town of Al-Zarqa [45] . A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother did subsequently develop antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection [46] . Her exposure history to a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive relative and an antibody-reactive husband, her incubation period and her symptom history met the WHO criteria for being a probable MERS-CoV case [46] . Diagnostic methods were published within days of the ProMED email announcing the first MERS case [47] , including several now gold standard in-house RT-rtPCR assays (Fig. 2 ) as well as virus culture in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells [18, 47, 48] . A colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) epithelial cell line has since been recommended for isolation of infections MERS-CoV [49] . We previously [18] . ).

Beneath this is a schematic depicting the location of RT-PCR primers (blue arrows indicate direction) and oligoprobes (green rectangles) used in the earliest RT-rtPCR screening assays and conventional, semi-nested (three primers) RT-PCR confirmatory sequencing assays [47, 48] .

[47, 48] Those assays recommended by the WHO are highlighted underneath by yellow dots [53] . The NSeq reverse primer has consistently contained one sequence mismatch with some MERS-CoV variants. An altered version of that from Mackay IM, Arden KE. Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd. Virus Res 2015 Vol 202:60-88 with permission from Elsevier [5] reviewed the broad tropism of MERS-CoV [5] . However, as is well described, cell culture is a slow, specialised and insensitive method [50] while PCR-based techniques are the preferred method for MERS-CoV detection. The first open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b; Fig. 2 ) have become a key diagnostic and taxonomic target for CoV species identification. With less than 80 % identity between the amino acid sequence of MERS ORF 1ab and betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, it can be concluded that it is a novel and distinct virus. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode ten open reading frames with 5' and 3' untranslated regions [51] . The structural proteins include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [52] . The products of ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode nonstructural proteins. The majority of specimen testing to date has employed validated RT-rtPCR assays shown to be sensitive and specific [47, 48, 53] . The RealStar® kit uses these WHOrecommended assays [54] . The target sequences of these screening assays have not changed among genomes examined until at least mid-2015 (IMM observation). Other RT-rtPCR assays have been developed and validated for use as laboratory-based diagnostic tools [55] [56] [57] . Additionally, loop-mediated [58, 59] or recombinase polymerase [60] isothermal assays have been designed for field deployment. The detection of MERS-CoV antigen has not been common to date but the combination of short turnaround time from test to result, high throughput and identification of viral proteins makes this an attractive option. Detection of viral proteins rather than viral RNA indicates the likely presence of infectious virus. The first rapid immunochromatographic tool described could detect recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein from DC nasal swabs with 94 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity compared to RT-rtPCR [61] . A different approach used a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein with a sensitivity of 10 3 TCID 50 and 100 % specificity [62] . Demonstration of a seroconversion to a MERS-CoV infection meets the current WHO definition of a case so optimized and thoroughly validated sero-assays employed alongside good clinical histories are useful to both identify prior MERS-CoV infection and help support transmission studies. Because serology testing is, by its nature, retrospective, it is usual to detect a viral footprint, in the form of antibodies, in the absence of any signs or symptoms of disease and often in the absence of any viral RNA [63] . Strategic, widespread sero-surveys of humans using samples collected after 2012 are infrequent. Much of the Arabian Peninsula and all of the Horn of Africa lack baseline data describing the proportion of the community who may have been infected by a MERS-CoV. However, sero-surveys have had widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a transmission source for MERS-CoV. Because of the identity shared between DC and human MERS-CoV (see Molecular epidemiology: using genomes to understand outbreaks), serological assays for DC sero-surveys should be transferrable to human screening with minimal re-configuration.Question: What do patients often present to a hospital with, in cases of MERS?","answer":"pneumonia"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The proposed algorithms combine the benefits of machine learning with the formal guarantees available through algorithm theory.  We prove that our learning-based algorithms have lower estimation errors than their non-learning counterparts.  We also evaluate our algorithms on two real-world datasets and demonstrate empirically their performance gains.Classical algorithms provide formal guarantees over their performance, but often fail to leverage useful patterns in their input data to improve their output.On the other hand, deep learning models are highly successful at capturing and utilizing complex data patterns, but often lack formal error bounds.The last few years have witnessed a growing effort to bridge this gap and introduce algorithms that can adapt to data properties while delivering worst case guarantees.Deep learning modules have been integrated into the design of Bloom filters (Kraska et al., 2018; BID18 , caching algorithms (Lykouris & Vassilvitskii, 2018) , graph optimization BID12 , similarity search BID22 BID29 ) and compressive sensing BID3 .This paper makes a significant step toward this vision by introducing frequency estimation streaming algorithms that automatically learn to leverage the properties of the input data.Estimating the frequencies of elements in a data stream is one of the most fundamental subroutines in data analysis.It has applications in many areas of machine learning, including feature selection BID0 , ranking (Dzogang et al., 2015) , semi-supervised learning BID27 and natural language processing (Goyal et al., 2012) .It has been also used for network measurements (Estan & Varghese, 2003; BID30 BID28 and security BID23 .Frequency estimation algorithms have been implemented in popular data processing libraries, such as Algebird at Twitter BID4 .They can answer practical questions like: what are the most searched words on the Internet?or how much traffic is sent between any two machines in a network?Thefrequency estimation problem is formalized as follows: given a sequence S of elements from some universe U , for any element i ∈ U , estimate f i , the number of times i occurs in S. If one could store all arrivals from the stream S, one could sort the elements and compute their frequencies. However, in big data applications, the stream is too large (and may be infinite) and cannot be stored. This challengehas motivated the development of streaming algorithms, which read the elements of S in a single pass and compute a good estimate of the frequencies using a limited amount of space.1 Over the lasttwo decades, many such streaming algorithms have been developed, including Count-Sketch BID7 , Count-Min BID11 ) and multistage filters (Estan & Varghese, 2003) . The performanceguarantees of these algorithms are wellunderstood, with upper and lower bounds matching up to O(·) factors (Jowhari et al., 2011) .However, such streamingalgorithms typically assume generic data and do not leverage useful patterns or properties of their input. For example, in text data, the word frequency is known to be inversely correlated with the length of the word. Analogously, in networkdata, certain applications tend to generate more traffic than others. If such properties canbe harnessed, one could design frequency estimation algorithms that are much more efficient than the existing ones. Yet, it is important todo so in a general framework that can harness various useful properties, instead of using handcrafted methods specific to a particular pattern or structure (e.g., word length, application type).In this paper, we introducelearning-based frequency estimation streaming algorithms. Our algorithms are equippedwith a learning model that enables them to exploit data properties without being specific to a particular pattern or knowing the useful property a priori. We further provide theoreticalanalysis of the guarantees associated with such learning-based algorithms.We focus on the important class of \\"hashing-based\\" algorithms, which includes some of the most used algorithms such as Count-Min, Count-Median and Count-Sketch. Informally, these algorithms hashdata items into B buckets, count the number of items hashed into each bucket, and use the bucket value as an estimate of item frequency. The process can be repeated usingmultiple hash functions to improve accuracy. Hashing-based algorithms have severaluseful properties. In particular, they can handle item deletions, which are implemented by decrementing the respective counters. Furthermore, some of them (notably Count-Min) never underestimate the true frequencies, i.e., f i ≥ f i holds always. However, hashing algorithms lead to estimationerrors due to collisions: when two elements are mapped to the same bucket, they affect each others' estimates. Although collisions are unavoidable given thespace constraints, the overall error significantly depends on the pattern of collisions. For example, collisions between high-frequencyelements (\\"heavy hitters\\") result in a large estimation error, and ideally should be minimized. The existing algorithms, however, use random hashfunctions, which means that collisions are controlled only probabilistically.Our idea is to use a small subset of S, call it S , to learn the heavy hitters. We can then assign heavy hitters their own bucketsto avoid the more costly collisions. It is important to emphasize that we are learningthe properties that identify heavy hitters as opposed to the identities of the heavy hitters themselves. For example, in the word frequency case, shorterwords tend to be more popular. The subset S itself may miss many of the popularwords, but whichever words popular in S are likely to be short. Our objective is not to learn the identity of highfrequency words using S . Rather, we hope that a learning model trained on Slearns that short words are more frequent, so that it can identify popular words even if they did not appear in S .Our main contributions are as follows:• We introducelearning-based frequency estimation streaming algorithms, which learn the properties of heavy hitters in their input and exploit this information to reduce errors• We provide performance guarantees showing that our algorithms can deliver a logarithmic factor improvement in the error bound over their non-learning counterparts. Furthermore, we show that our learning-based instantiationof Count-Min, a widely used algorithm, is asymptotically optimal among all instantiations of that algorithm. See Table 4 .1 in section 4.1 for the details.• We evaluateour learning-based algorithms using two real-worlddatasets: traffic load on an Internet backbone link and search query popularity. In comparison to their non-learning counterparts, our algorithmsyield performance gains that range from 18% to 71%.We have presented a new approach for designing frequency estimation streaming algorithms by augmenting them with a learning model that exploits data properties.We have demonstrated the benefits of our design both analytically and empirically.We envision that our work will motivate a deeper integration of learning in algorithm design, leading to more efficient algorithms.","answer":"Data stream algorithms can be improved using deep learning, while retaining performance guarantees."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.(METHODS) Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.(RESULTS) Plasma creatine and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P<0.01), kidney (P<0.01), liver (P<0.01) and heart (P<0.05) mass at term. CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P<0.05) and skeletal muscle (P<0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart (P<0.05) and kidney (P<0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant spiny mice at term. Renal AGAT mRNA (P<0.01) and protein (P<0.05) expression were both significantly up-regulated at term, with decreased expression of AGAT mRNA (<0.01) and GAMT protein (<0.05) observed in the term pregnant heart.

Implicit generativemodels specify a stochastic procedure to produce outputs from a probability distribution. Such models are appealingbecause they do not demand parametrization of the probability distribution they are trying to model. Recently, there has beengreat interest in CNN-based implicit generative models using autoregressive BID4 and adversarial training frameworks BID16 .Generative adversarial networks(GANs) BID7 can be seen as a two player minimax game where the first player, the generator, is tasked with transforming a random input to a specific distribution such that the second player, the discriminator, can not distinguish between the true and synthesized distributions. The most distinctive feature ofadversarial networks is the discriminator that assesses the discrepancy between the current and target distributions. The discriminator acts as a progressivelyprecise critic of an increasingly accurate generator. Despite their structured prediction capabilities, such a training paradigm is often unstable. However, recent work on spectral normalization(SN) and gradient penalty has significantly increased training stability BID8 . Conditional GANs (cGANs) BID19 incorporate conditionalimage information in the discriminator and have been widely used for class conditioned image generation . To that effect, unlike in standard GANs, a discriminatorfor cGANs discriminates between the generated distribution and the target distribution on pairs of samples y and conditional information x.For class conditioning, several unique strategies have been presented to incorporate class information in the discriminator BID24 BID23 . DISPLAYFORM0 Adversarial loss (a) Concatenated Image Conditioningx y Adversarial loss DISPLAYFORM1 Discriminator models for image conditioning. We propose fusing the features of the input and the ground truthor generated image rather than concatenating.However, a cGAN can also be conditioned by structured data such as an image. Such conditioning is much more useful for structured predictionproblems. Since the discriminator in an image conditioned-GAN has accessto large portions of the image the adversarial loss can be interpreted as a learned loss that incorporates higher order statistics, essentially eliminating the need to manually design higher order loss functions. This variation of cGANs has extensively been used for image-to-imagetranslation tasks . However, the best way of incorporating conditional image informationinto a GAN is not clear, and methods of feeding generated and conditional images to the discriminator tend to use a naive concatenation approach. In this work we address this gap by proposing a discriminator architecturespecifically designed for image conditioning. Such a discriminator contributes to the promise of generalization that GANsbring to structured prediction problems by providing a singular and simplistic setup for capturing higher order non-local structural information from higher dimensional data without complicated modeling of energy functions.Contributions. We propose an approach to incorporating conditional information into a cGANusing a fusion discriminator architecture (Fig. 1b) . In particular, we make the following key contributions:1. We propose a noveldiscriminator architecture designed to incorporating conditionalinformation for structured prediction tasks. The method is designed to incorporate conditional information in feature space in away that allows the discriminator to enforce higher-order consistency in the model, and is conceptually simpler than alternative structured prediction methods such as CNN-CRFs where higher-order potentials have to be manually incorporated in the loss function.2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a variety of distinct structuredprediction tasks including semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and generating real images from semantic masks. Our empirical study demonstrates that the fusion discriminator is effective in preservinghigh-order statistics and structural information in the data and is flexible enough to be used successfully for many structured prediction tasks.2 RELATED WORK 2.1 CNN-CRF MODELS Models for structured prediction have been extensively studiedin computer vision. In the past these models often entailed the construction of hand-engineered features. In 2015,BID15 demonstrated that a fully convolutional approach to semantic segmentation couldyield state-ofthe-art results at that time with no need for hand-engineering features. BID1 showed that post-processing the results of a CNN with a conditional Markov random field ledto significant improvements. Subsequent work by many authors have refined this approach by incorporating the CRF as a layer withina deep network and thereby enabling the parameters of both models to be learnt simultaneously BID11 . Many researchers have used this approach for other structured prediction problems, including image-to-imagetranslation and depth estimation BID14 .In most cases CNN-CRF models only incorporate unary and pairwise potentials. BID0 investigated incorporatinghigher-order potentials into CNN-based models for semantic segmentation, andfound that while it is possible to learn the parameters of these potentials, they can be tedious to incorporate and render the model quite complex. Thus there is a need to develop methods that can incorporate higher-order statistical information without requiringmanual modeling of higher order potentials.Structured prediction problems can be posed as image conditioned GAN problems.The discriminator plays a crucial role in incorporating non-local information in adversarial training setups for structured prediction problems.Image conditioned GANs usually feed concatenated input and output pairs to the discriminator.In this research, we proposed a model for the discriminator of cGANs that involves fusing features from both the input and the output image in feature space.This method provides the discriminator a hierarchy of features at different scales from the conditional data, and thereby allows the discriminator to capture higher-order statistics from the data.We qualitatively demonstrate and empirically validate that this simple modification can significantly improve the general adversarial framework for structured prediction tasks.The results presented in this paper strongly suggest that the mechanism of feeding paired information into the discriminator in image conditioned GAN problems is of paramount importance.6SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL","answer":"We propose the fusion discriminator, a novel architecture for incorporating conditional information into the discriminator of GANs for structured prediction tasks."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

children is favorable if conscious sedation is needed .  mortensen et al .   published a retrospective series of 80 pediatric videostroboscopy patients , all of whom were previously examined by flexible laryngoscopy and treated with speech therapy for a presumed diagnosis of vocal cord nodules .   the authors concluded that children with a history of prolonged dysphonia for whom treatment has failed should be referred for evaluation by videolaryngostroboscopy .  its value includes elucidation of subtle features of different disease processes : clarification of the differences between benign mucosal disorders that might require surgical intervention and assistance in identifying inflammatory processes that contribute to dysphonia .  finally , the only validated grading scale for pediatric vocal fold nodules is based on a transnasal videolaryngostroboscopic examination .be developed in order for clinicians to precisely communicate with one another and comparatively publish meaningful translational research .   clearly , for the standard of pediatric voice care to approximate that in adults , some alternative means of performing videolaryngostroboscopy is needed in children uncooperative for such an assessment in an office setting .   a small number of series have demonstrated the effectiveness of rigid and flexible videolaryngostroboscopy in pediatric patients [ 2 , 3 ] .   unlike the mortensen study , what is unclear and not stated in these reports is the total number of children on whom videolaryngostroboscopy was attempted but failed in the voice clinic .   despite great effort in our voice center to familiarize and desensitize children to the equipment and procedure , some children are , nonetheless , unable to tolerate even a brief examination .  it is likely that this limitation contributes to the fact that unlike in adults , pediatric videolaryngostroboscopy has failed to gain widespread acceptance .   this study reports our conscious sedation protocol and results for successful videolaryngostroboscopy in children unable to tolerate the examination in the voice clinic while fully awake .the protocol was reviewed by the hospital 's institutional review board ( irb ) and approved by expedited review , in compliance with hipaa guidelines ( irb no .consecutive children evaluated in the voice , resonance and swallowing center at the children 's hospital of pittsburgh of university of pittsburgh medical center from june 2007 through june 2008 and undergoing videolaryngostroboscopy , as a diagnostic procedure , were included .  all patients failed initial videolaryngostroboscopy as an outpatient procedure despite topical anesthesia and completion of a pediatric desensitization protocol .the overall rate of patients that underwent videolaryngostroboscopy in the operating room was 12% including patients that failed were noncompliant in the clinic as well as patients scheduled to undergo other procedures in the operating room for reasons unrelated to their voice problem .a standardized sedation technique was employed .   midazolam ( 0.5  mg / kg po or 0.2  mg / kg intranasal )after application of routine monitoring ( pulse oximetry , ekg , and non - invasive blood pressure ) , a nitrous oxide ( 70%)/oxygen ( 30% ) mixture was administered by mask to facilitate intravenous cannula insertion .  meperidine was then administered intravenously in increments ( total dose : range 0.41.75  mg / kg ) .   because patient number 5 was adult sized, fentanyl ( total dose 100  mcg ) was substituted for meperidine . simultaneously with the administration of meperidine , oxymetazoline was administered as a topical nasal decongestant and 1% lidocaine for topical anesthesia .  finally , propofol was administered , initially in bolus increments ( total dose : range 0.422.63  mg / kg ) for the first 8 patients ; because of pain at the site of injection , the mode of administration was switched to a constant infusion ( 3550  mcg / kg / min ) for patients   number 5 , 9 , and 10 .no jaw thrust , chin lift , continuous positive airway pressure , oral / nasal airways , or other airway maneuvers were used during the procedure .  lidocaine ( 1% for all but patient no . 5 who received 4% ) was applied to the larynx .   the main outcome measures were the child 's ability to follow commands and tolerate flexible videolaryngostroboscopy .  secondary outcome measures included total phonation time , complications , a need for subsequent videolaryngostroboscopic attempts , clinical outcomes , and followup .mean age was 6 years ( sd 3.7 years ; range : 2 to 14 years ) .  flexible nasal endoscopy was attempted in clinic in 2 patients when the parents felt the child would cooperate for the exam and when the child was agreeable to the procedure .  the remaining children were enrolled because their parents asserted in the voice clinic that they knew their children would not tolerate the procedure without sedation and , hence , were unwilling to consent .nine of ten children were able to complete the exam with adequate time of phonation for analysis and diagnosis .one of the 10 patients failed to complete the videolaryngostroboscopy ; this was the same child that failed the flexible nasal endoscopy in clinic .   the most common findings on subjective voice analysispreoperatively were harshness and breathiness associated with hyperfunction and strain .   the most common diagnosis made with videolaryngostroboscopy was true vocal cord ( tvc ) nodules , found in 8/10 patients .  this 4-point grading scale based on videolaryngostroboscopic assessment for nodule size is as follows : grade of 0 normal / complete adduction with smooth vocal fold contour ( i.e. , no nodule present ) , grade 1 normal complete adduction with a small nodule located on the vibratory edge protruding less than 0.5  mm , grade 2 nodules may be associated with an anterior glottic chink on adduction with a moderate sized nodule protruding >  0.51.0  mm , and grade 3 nodules associated with an  hourglass  configuration of aperture closure on adduction with a large nodule protruding > 1.0  mm on the vibratory edge .d  when the base of the nodule was no more than twice the width or sessile , subscript the mean exam time was 2 minutes 52 seconds ( sd 86 seconds ) , phonation time , which represented total phonation time to diagnosis , is 1 minute 44 seconds ( sd 60 seconds ) , and numbers of tasks completed were 10.5 ( sd 8.6 ) .   tasks include maximum phonation time , sustained vowel productions , mucosal wave assessment at low , medium , and high pitch and at different levels of intensity .  phase symmetry , amplitude , glottic aperture closure configuration , true vocal fold vertical height , and vocal cord morphology were readily assessed and documented . \\t\\t\\t\\tconstant infusion of propofol was tolerated better because of decreased discomfort at the site of infusion .  one child ( patient 8) was initially over sedated but was able to be reversed to perform a full evaluation .  patient ( 6 ) who was crying for the entire duration of the exam still had evaluable mucosal waves which allowed assessment of nearly all stroboscopic metrics .one of the children ( not included in table 1 ) was an autistic child with severe cognitive impairment who developed velopharyngeal insufficiency after adenoidectomy and did not respond to conservative medical management .  the exam was limited to basic endoscopy to evaluate pharyngeal closure patterns with the child following similar commands with the same anesthetic protocol .  this 14  y / o patient demonstrated a small ( i.e. , < 2.0  cm ) central gap / closure .  his total exam time was 1 minute and 59 seconds and phonation time was 1 minute and 41 seconds .   by defining the pattern of closure and size of the central gap , surgical correction of his vpi was successfully planned and executed which would have otherwise been impossible without such a functional evaluation .our secondary outcome measures include complications , need for subsequent videolaryngostroboscopic attempts , clinical outcomes , and followup .  there were no complications from the procedure and none needed additional attempts because all had complete evaluations in the operating room .  pediatric voice disorders are not uncommon  with a range of incidence from 1% to 20% based on different series [ 68 ] .  it is likely that as diagnostic and therapeutic methods improve and as awareness amongst primary care physicians increases , the incidence will increase .  evaluation of children with voice disorders is a challenge considering that examination of the larynx requires tolerance of an endoscopic visualization of the larynx .  videolaryngostroboscopy is standard of care in adult laryngology and is critical to proper diagnosis and management .  it offers evaluation of the larynx and any inherent structural changes , in addition to diagnosing gross pathology .  it allows for an assessment of functional features not possible with conventional endoscopic techniques .    a study by wolf et al .they found that the main factors for failure of the procedure were gag reflex , short phonation time , and epiglottic position in certain instances .  the youngest child in this study was 6 years of age and the most common diagnosis was vocal cord nodules , followed by vocal cord cysts .  a more recent series by hartnick and zeitels describes their experience with flexible videolaryngostroboscopy in 25 children ranging from 19 months to 13 years with the mean age of 7 years .  they report successful exams in all 25 children using a 3.2 to 3.9  mm nasal flexible laryngostroboscopy .  their most frequent diagnosis was also vocal cord nodules .   as noted in the introduction of this paper but worthy of emphasisis that the only validated grading scale for pediatric vocal fold nodules , the most common cause of dysphonia in children , is based on a transnasal videolaryngostroboscopic examination .   this study describes a successful algorithm for videolaryngostroboscopy in uncooperative children unable to tolerate the procedure in the voice center .   our algorithm sedates the child while preserving the child 's capacity to fully cooperate with the phonatory tasks needed for such an assessment .in addition , the actual phonation and exam times were measured and documented , metrics heretofore unpublished in the literature .   in the current series, there was only one child who did not tolerate the procedure yet a diagnosis was still made based on the laryngoscopic exam .  future research will focus on adjustments to the protocol to enable stroboscopy in such a patient as well as to report a larger sample size that reinforces this pilot proof - of - principal study .    there are no current publications in the peer - reviewed literature specifically outlining a protocol for this highly specialized application , namely , pediatric videolaryngostroboscopy .in addition , this study introduces a novel algorithm for combining known medications , in a manner that is unique both in temporal administration as well as in the sequence of administration .  such an algorithm bridges the gap between the needs of the anesthesiologist and the otolaryngologist so that routine videolaryngostroboscopy can be added to the arsenal of diagnostic tools available to pediatric population .we have successfully described and demonstrated a novel conscious sedation protocol that facilitates videolaryngostroboscopy in uncooperative children unable to tolerate the procedure in the voice center with excellent results .  future studies will test the algorithm using a prospective study design in a larger cohort of patients .  adjustments to the current protocol will also be explored for the extremely rare patient still unable to tolerate videolaryngostroboscopy .","answer":"objective . to determine best sedation protocol for videolaryngostroboscopy in children unable to tolerate non - sedated evaluation . materials

sectional imaging of the penis , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) may provide important diagnostic information in the investigation of penile pathology , especially in cases of inconclusive or nondiagnostic sonographic findings .recently , functional mri , including diffusion - weighted imaging ( dwi ) , magnetization transfer imaging ( mti ) , and dynamic contrast - enhanced ( dce ) mri have been used in the interpretation of scrotal diseases . to our knowledge ,no reports regarding these techniques in the evaluation of penile diseases exist in the english literature . herein , we present the mri findings of a silicone - induced penile lipogranuloma .a multiparametric mri protocol was used , including dwi , mti , and dce - mri .a 52-year - old man was referred to the urology department with significant enlargement of the penis and sexual dysfunction of 1-year duration . the patient reported a history of subcutaneous injection of liquid silicone in the penis by a nonmedical practitioner , 10 years ago .clinical examination revealed large , painless enlargement of the penile shaft due to the presence of a hard mass invading the skin and the subcutaneous tissues , but not the corpora cavernosae .mri examination was done on a 1.5-t system , with the penis in the flaccid state .the mr protocol included axial spin - echo t1-weighted sequences , fast spin - echo t2-weighted sequences in the three orthogonal planes and transverse dw sequences with b - values of 0 and 900 s / mm .mti was followed in the same plane . magnetization transfer ratio ( mtr ) was calculated from the following equation : where , sim and sio refer to signal intensities with and without the saturation pulse , respectively . after a rapid injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine , sagittal dce subtraction mris were also obtained .a heterogeneous , ill - defined mass involving the subcutaneous tissues around the penis and extending into the intertesticular and retrotesticular region were detected [ figure 1 ] .the lesion was asymmetrically y - shaped with the arms of y around corpora carvenosae , slightly hyperintense , and extremely hypointense on t1- and t2-weighted images [ figure 1a ] , respectively when compared to the penile shaft .the mean adc was 1.53  10 mm / s [ figure 1b ] , similar to that of corpora carvenosae and suggestive of benignity .mtis showed the very low signal intensity of the mass , with a mean mtr of 67% , suggestive of the presence of macromolecules [ figure 1c and d ] . on dynamic imaging ,the lesion enhanced strongly and heterogeneously , with an initial upstroke , followed by gradual increase of enhancement in late postcontrast phase [ figure 1e ] .both the corpora cavernosae and the corpus spongiosum were normal , with intact tunica albuginea .based on mri findings and the clinical history , the diagnosis of silicone - induced penile lipogranuloma was strongly suggested , and the patient was referred for surgical excision of the lesion . 52-year - old man with silicone - induced penile sclerosing lipogranuloma .( a ) sagittal t2-weighted image of the penis demonstrates heterogeneous lesion , with ill - defined margins surrounding the penis .the mass ( arrowheads ) was mainly of low signal intensity on t2-weighted images , a finding suggestive of the presence of fibrous tissue .( b ) transverse apparent diffusion coefficient map ( b = 900 mm / s ) shows heterogeneous mass ( arrow ) surrounding the penile shaft .the lesion appears mainly isointense when compared to the normal corpora cavernosa ( long arrow ) .the apparent diffusion coefficient value of the mass was 1.53  10 mm / s ( right corpus cavernosum : 1.49  10 mm / s ; left corpus cavernosum : 1.60  10 mm / s ) .transverse three - dimensional gradient - echo images acquired ( c ) without and ( d ) with the application of the magnetization transfers pulse .the magnetization transfer signal of the mass lesion ( arrowhead ) was qualitatively lower than that of the corpora cavernosa ( arrow ) .( e ) time - signal intensity curve of the lesion shows an initial upstroke after which the signal intensity gradually increases in the late contrast - enhanced phase . during surgerythe lesion was solid and white , invading the skin , the subcutaneous tissues , and the dartos muscle of the penis .histopathological examination demonstrated vacuoles of variable size corresponding to exogeneous substance , embedded in collageneous stroma .the patient had an uneventful recovery and was advised to return for follow - up 2 months after surgery .histopathologic evaluation of the excised tissue reveals vacuoles of variable size in the dermis corresponding to exogeneous substance .multinucleated giant cells and abundant fibrosis is seen around the vacuoles ( hematoxylin and eosin stain , magnification 20 ) .penile sclerosing lipogranuloma is a granulomatous reaction that occurs after injury of the adipose tissue .the secondary type of the disease is caused by foreign body injections directly into the penis , such as silicone , paraffin oil , paraffin balm , and mineral oils .secondary penile sclerosing lipogranuloma usually requires an aggressive treatment including partial or total excision of granulomas , with or without reconstructive skin flaps depending on the extent of excision .an imaging technique accurately characterizing and assessing the extent of the disease would be valuable in the appropriate preoperative planning of these patients .mri is now increasingly used as either a problem - solving tool in cases of indeterminate sonographic findings or as a primary imaging modality in the evaluation of penile diseases .specifically , mri has been proved useful in the differentiation between benign and malignant penile lesions and in defining the extent of inflammatory processes and traumatic injuries .it is also considered the most accurate imaging technique in the assessment of primary penile carcinomas .motoori et al . , described the mri findings of a primary scrlerosing lipogranuloma of the male genitalia in a 55-year - old man .the lesion was symmetrically y - shaped , with the arms of the y surrounding the penile shaft .the mass showed similar and moderately high signal intensity when compared to muscles on t1- and t2-weighted images , respectively , with irregular enhancement after gadolinium administration .small areas within the lesion , hyperintense on t2-weighted sequences , without contrast enhancement , suggested the presence of cystic or necrotic parts .the mass demonstrated an ill - defined symmetrical y - shape , situated just beneath the corpus spongiosum with the arms of the y around the penile shaft .the lesion was mainly isointense on t1-weighted images , strongly enhancing , with low signal intensity on t2-weighted images , the latter related to the presence of fibrous tissue .an asymmetrically y - shaped mass surrounding the carvenosal bodies and extending into the scrotum was revealed in our patient .the hypointensity of the mass on t2-weighted sequences was suggestive of the presence of fibrous tissue , as subsequently proved on pathology and it is considered an important diagnostic feature in differentiating this entity from malignancy .lesion detection and characterization on dwi is mainly dependent on the extent of tissue cellularity , and increased cellularity is associated with restricted diffusion and reduced adc .the adc values of malignancies are usually lower than those of benign lesions or normal tissues . in this case , no areas of restricted diffusion were identified within the mass , and the adc was similar to that of normal corpora cavernosae , findings strongly suggestive of benignity .mti sequences offer a different image contrast compared to t1- and t2-weighted images . in conventional mris, tissue contrast depends mainly on the presence of free protons , whereas , on mtis , the signal is determined by the restricted macromolecular protons . the mt phenomenon is quantified by the mtr .tissues containing macromolecules , a classical example is fibrous tissue , transfer magnetization more efficiently detected as hypointense on mtis , with high mtr , as in this patient .dce - mri evaluates the kinetics of the distribution of the paramagnetic contrast medium in the micro - vessels and the interstitial spaces of the tissues used .malignancies usually present with the rapid uptake of the contrast medium , followed by washout in the delayed phase , whereas benign lesions often enhance strongly and rapidly , followed by either a plateau or gradual increase of enhancement in the late post - contrast phase .although , there are no reports on the dce - mri characteristics of penile lesions in the english literature , penile lipogranuloma in this case enhanced intensely , followed by a gradual increase of enhancement in the late post - contrast phase , findings that could suggest the benign nature of the lesion .mri examination using both morphologic and functional data provided valuable information in the preoperative planning in our case , by estimating the precise extent of the mass and helping in the characterization of the benign nature of disease .","answer":"sclerosing lipogranuloma is a rare benign disease , representing a peculiar granulomatous reaction of fatty tissue .  the majority of cases are secondary to injection of exogenous foreign bodies , such as silicone , paraffin , mineral , or vegetable oils . to the best of our knowledge ,  we present the first case of a silicone -

Semaphorins comprise a family of molecules that influence neuronal growth and guidance. Class-3 semaphorins, semaphorin-3B (SEMA3B) and semaphorin-3F (SEMA3F), illustrate their effects by forming a complex with neuropilins (NP-1 or NP-2) and plexins. We examined the status and regulation of semaphorins and their receptors in human ovarian cancer cells. A significantly reduced expression of SEMA3B (83 kDa), SEMA3F (90 kDa), and plexin-A3 was observed in ovarian cancer cell lines when compared with normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells. The expression of NP-1, NP-2, and plexin-A1 was not altered in human ovarian surface epithelial and ovarian cancer cells. The decreased expression of SEMA3B, SEMA3F, and plexin-A3 was confirmed in stage 3 ovarian tumors. The treatment of ovarian cancer cells with luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estrogen induced a significant upregulation of SEMA3B, whereas SEMA3F was upregulated only by estrogen. Cotreatment of cell lines with a hormone and its specific antagonist blocked the effect of the hormone. Ectopic expression of SEMA3B or SEMA3F reduced soft-agar colony formation, adhesion, and cell invasion of ovarian cancer cell cultures. Forced expression of SEMA3B, but not SEMA3F, inhibited viability of ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of SEMA3B and SEMA3F reduced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in ovarian cancer cells. Forced expression of SEMA3F, but not SEMA3B in ovarian cancer cells, significantly inhibited endothelial cell tube formation. Collectively, our results suggest that the loss of SEMA3 expression could be a hallmark of cancer progression. Furthermore, gonadotropin- and/or estrogen-mediated maintenance of SEMA3 expression could control ovarian cancer angiogenesis and metastasis.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"ovarian cancer cells\\", \\"ovarian surface epithelial\\", \\"ovarian cancer cell lines\\", \\"cancer\\", \\"ovarian tumors\\", \\"colony\\", \\"cell\\", \\"ovarian surface epithelial cells\\", \\"endothelial cell tube\\", \\"cell lines\\", \\"ovarian cancer\\", \\"ovarian cancer cell cultures\\", \\"neuronal\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

The COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor (COUP-TF) exists in a number of different tissues and is essential for expression of the chicken ovalbumin gene. It binds to the ovalbumin promoter and, in conjunction with a second protein (S300-II), stimulates initiation of transcription in vitro. COUP-TF also binds specifically to the rat insulin promoter element, although the two binding sites share little sequence similarity. Here we report the isolation of a human complementary DNA clone encoding COUP-TF. Comparison of the amino-acid sequence of COUP-TF with known sequences reveals that it is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone/vitamin receptor superfamily. Consequently, it is the first member of this family that has been shown to function in a cell-free transcription system. We conclude that this superfamily of gene regulators contains proteins which bind and activate distal promoter elements of eukaryotic genes.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"ovalbumin\\", \\"S300-II\\", \\"steroid receptor\\", \\"COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor\\", \\"COUP-TF\\", \\"steroid/thyroid hormone/vitamin receptor\\", \\"ovalbumin promoter\\", \\"COUP transcription factor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

deuteron scattering length can be well understood in terms of the dominant isovector @xmath0-double scattering contribution .  we calculate in chiral perturbation theory all one - pion loop corrections to this double scattering term which in the case of @xmath1-scattering close the gap between the current - algebra prediction and the empirical value of the isovector threshold t - matrix @xmath2 .  in addition to closing this gap there is in the @xmath3-system a loop - induced off - shell correction for the exchanged virtual pion .  its coordinate space representation reveals that it is equivalent to @xmath4-exchange in the deuteron .  we evaluate the chirally corrected double scattering term and the off - shell contribution with various realistic deuteron wave functions .  we find that the off - shell correction contributes at most -8% and that the isovector double scattering term explains at least 90% of the empirical value of the real part of the @xmath3-scattering length .     24.cm 16.8 cm -1.0 cm -0.5 cm -0.5 cm # 1#2    # 2 cm    n. kaiser +    physik department t39 , technische universitt mnchen , d-85747 garching , germany    to be published in _ the physical review c ( 2002 ) , brief reports _    the tool to systematically investigate the consequences of spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is chiral perturbation theory .  recently , methodology has been developed @xcite which allows one to relate scattering processes involving a single nucleon to nuclear scattering processes .  for instance , one can relate pion - nucleon scattering to pion - deuteron scattering .  the non - perturbative effects responsible for deuteron binding are accounted for by ( phenomenological ) deuteron wavefunctions .  although this introduces some model dependence one can evaluate matrix elements of chiral operators in a variety of wavefunctions in order to estimate the theoretical error induced by the off - shell behavior of different nn - potentials .    in a recent precision experiment  the psi - group has extracted the isoscalar and isovector pion - nucleon scattering lengths @xmath5 from the shift and the width of the 1s - level in pionic hydrogen , with the result @xcite : @xmath6 @xmath7 one concludes from these results that the isoscalar @xmath0-scattering length @xmath8 is compatible with zero and that the ( present ) errors of @xmath9 are anti - correlated .  the aim of future psi - experiments is to measure the level width @xmath10 with the same precision as the level shift @xmath11 .  we have converted in eqs.(1,2 ) scattering lengths into equivalent threshold t - matrices by multiplying with the appropriate kinematical factor . @xmath12mev and @xmath13mev denote the proton and charged pion mass .    in an analogous psi - experiment the complex - valued pion - deuteron scattering length @xmath14 has been extracted from the shift and the width of the 1s - level in pionic deuterium @xcite . again converted into a threshold t - matrix the ( averaged ) experimental result of refs.@xcite reads for the real part , @xmath15 where @xmath16mev denotes the deuteron mass .    because of the large size ( and weak binding ) of the deuteron it is possible to establish an accurate relationship @xcite between the real part re@xmath17 and @xmath0 threshold t - matrices @xmath18 .  the single scattering contribution @xmath19 is small and within present error bars compatible with zero . the empirical value of the real part re@xmath20 can be well understood in terms of the dominant isovector double scattering term @xcite which reads , @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the conventional s- and d - state deuteron wavefunctions , normalized to @xmath24 .  the relation eq.(4 ) can be easily derived from the diagrams shown in fig.1 .  the four - momentum of the in- and out - going pion ( marked by arrows ) is @xmath25 and that of the exchanged virtual pion is @xmath26 .  after fourier - transforming the product of the corresponding pion - propagator @xmath27 and the deuteron momentum - distributions into coordinate space one gets @xmath28 times the deuteron density @xmath29 . the remaining factor @xmath30 originates from the isospin factors of the diagrams .  the advantage of working with threshold t - matrices ( which are directly related to feynman diagrams ) is that there appear no additional kinematical factors in eq.(4 ) .  other three - body interaction terms induced by @xmath31-interaction ( the in- and out - going pion couple to a virtual pion in flight ) which are formally of the same chiral order have been evaluated in refs.@xcite and they were found to be negligibly small  . for extensive earlier works on the pion - deuteron scattering length and related issues , see refs.@xcite .     the shortcoming of the present chiral perturbation theory calculations of re@xmath20 is that the isovector double scattering contribution eq.(4 ) is ( and for reasons of consistency has to be ) evaluated with the leading order expression @xmath32fm for the isovector @xmath0 threshold t - matrix . as usual  @xmath33mev denotes the weak pion decay constant .  since this tomozawa - weinberg prediction @xmath34 is about 13% smaller than the empirical ( central ) value of @xmath35 ( see eq.(2 ) ) the ( leading order ) chiral isovector double scattering contribution to re@xmath36 comes out about 25% too small , as can be seen from the numbers given in table1 of ref.@xcite .  in fact , weinberg argued in ref.@xcite that because of its dominance the isovector double scattering contribution eq.(4 ) should be calculated including vertex corrections and he simply took the measured @xmath0-scattering length @xmath37 .  the purpose of the present paper is to study in the systematic framework of chiral perturbation theory the corrections to this simple substitution rule .     it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the about 13% gap between the current algebra prediction @xmath34 and the empirical value of @xmath35 is closed by chiral one - pion loop corrections at order @xmath38 .  all other possible corrections from resonances etc .  are much too small to close this gap .  keeping only the important pion - loop correction the chiral expansion of the on - shell isovector @xmath0 threshold t - matrix reads @xcite , @xmath39 with @xmath40 a scale parameter introduced in dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction . with @xmath41gev the central empirical value of @xmath35 is reproduced .  the scale parameter @xmath40 can also be interpreted as a momentum space cut - off @xmath42 . by comparing with the expression of relevant ( logarithmically divergent ) loop integral obtained in cut - off regularization  one finds the relation @xmath43mev .  this value of the cut - off @xmath42 is comparable to the usual estimate of the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath44mev .    in order to improve on the isovector double scattering contribution @xmath45 one  should therefore include pion - loop corrections at the @xmath46 transition vertices .  the grey disk in the diagrams in fig.1 symbolizes all one - loop graphs of ( isovector ) @xmath0-scattering .  now , since the exchanged pion with four - momentum @xmath26 is off its mass - shell the loop diagrams included in the grey disk will lead for such a half off - shell kinematics to more than the order @xmath47 loop correction to @xmath35 given in eq.(5 ) .     in addition there is an off - shell contribution @xmath48(off ) which turns out to be generated entirely by the two graphs shown in fig.2 involving the chiral @xmath49-vertex .  this off - shell contribution reads explicitly , @xmath50   bigg [ { s over q } ln { s+ q over 2m_pi } -1 bigg ] bigg } nonumber  & = &   { m_pi   over 2f_pi^2 } ,g^v_e(-q^2 ) _  { loop} , , end{aligned} ] ] with the abbreviation @xmath51 .  as indicated it is proportional to the one - pion loop contribution to the isovector electric form factor of the nucleon @xmath52 ( normalized to unity at @xmath53 ) .  we also note that the off - shell correction @xmath48(off ) in eq.(6 ) is independent of the choice of the interpolating pion - field even though the ( off - shell ) @xmath49-vertex is not .    with inclusion of chiral pion - loop corrections to the threshold t - matrix @xmath35  the isovector double scattering term takes the form , @xmath54 int_{1/ lambda}^infty dr , { rho(r ) over pi r } ,, ] ] which is practically equivalent to inserting the empirical value of @xmath55 into eq.(4 ) .  the effect of the off - shell correction eq.(6 ) to re@xmath56 is obtained by multiplying @xmath48(off ) with the pion - propagator @xmath57 and fourier - transforming this product into coordinate space .  the terms in the first line of eq.(6 ) give this way a delta - function @xmath58 which exclusively probes the deuteron wavefunction at the origin .  the fourier - transform of the other non - polynomial terms in eq.(6 ) is most conveniently obtained with the help of a dispersion relation and one finds @xmath59 ,. ] ] one observes that the weight function multiplying the deuteron density @xmath29 goes like @xmath60 for @xmath61 . on the other hand  its asymptotic behavior for @xmath62 is @xmath63 , the typical form of a @xmath4-exchange potential .  in contrast to the double scattering term eq.(7 ) the off - shell correction eq.(8 ) is mainly sensitive to the short distance behavior of the deuteron wavefunction .  the @xmath60-singularity in eq.(8 ) originates from the large-@xmath64 behavior of the ( one - loop ) form factor in eq.(6 ) , which clearly is not realistic for large momentum transfers .  we regularize the @xmath60 short distance singularity ( in a minimal way ) by starting the radial integration at a nonzero @xmath65fm , where @xmath66mev is the ( equivalent ) momentum cut - off entering the chiral logarithm in eq.(5 ) .    [  cols=\\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\\",options=\\"header \\" , ]     in table 1 , we present numerical values of the chirally corrected double scattering contribution @xmath67 and the off - shell correction @xmath68 for various realistic deuteron wavefunctions taken from refs.@xcite .  one observes that the chirally corrected isovector double scattering contribution @xmath67 is rather stable and close to the empirical value of re@xmath20 in eq.(3 ) .  when starting the radial integration at @xmath69 instead of @xmath70fm these numbers are affected at most in the last digit .  the off - shell correction @xmath71 which is mainly sensitive to the short distance behavior of @xmath29 varies more with the deuteron wavefunction .  it is however always a small attractive effect whose relative magnitude does not exceed 8% .     we conclude that the ( chirally corrected ) isovector double scattering term explains at least 90% of the empirical value of the real part of the @xmath3 threshold t - matrix .  this is in agreement with the findings of ref.@xcite were a host of other small corrections to re@xmath20 has been investigated .  for example , in ref.@xcite an off - shell correction of the form eq.(6 ) proportional to a phenomenological dipole form factor ( minus unity ) has been considered . the off - shell correction eq.(6 ) obtained in the present work  has in fact a well - defined conceptual and physical origin .  it is the unique byproduct of the pion - loop graphs which close the gap between the current - algebra prediction and the empirical value of the isovector @xmath0 threshold t - matrix @xmath72 .  its effect on re@xmath20 is comparable to the inherent theoretical uncertainty of the isovector double scattering contribution @xmath67 ."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Treatment efficacy was evaluated clinically and at laparoscopy 6 months after medication. In relation to placebo, danazol and high-dose MPA treatments, which did not differ from each other in efficacy, significantly alleviated pelvic pain. In addition, the peritoneal endometriosis lesions found at 6-months laparoscopy were significantly smaller in the MPA and danazol groups than in the placebo group. Breakthrough bleeding, weight gain and acne complicated danazol treatment but only breakthrough bleeding complicated MPA treatment. These data suggest that postoperative treatment of advanced endometriosis with high-dose MPA or danazol is clinically beneficial.Title 2:Placebo-controlled comparison of danazol and high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate in the treatment of endometriosis.Abstract 2:A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of danazol and high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in the treatment of mild-moderate endometriosis. After laparoscopical confirmation of endometriosis, 59 patients were randomized to receive danazol (200 mg 3 times daily), MPA (100 mg daily) or placebo for 6 months. Clinical examinations were done before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the beginning of the study, and a 2nd laparoscopy 6 months after termination of the medication. Eighteen patients in the danazol group, 16 in the MPA group and 17 in the placebo group completed the trial. Total or partial resolution of peritoneal implants was observed in 60% of the patients receiving danazol and in 63% of the patients receiving MPA. In the placebo group, resolution was observed in 18%, while the size of the implants was estimated to be increased in 23% of the patients. In relation to placebo, danazol and MPA significantly alleviated endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, lower back pain and defecation pain, but they did not differ from each other in these actions. The appearance of acne, muscle cramps, edema, weight gain and spotting bleeding complicated MPA treatment. The present results indicate that because of good efficacy and tolerance, high-dose MPA is a useful alternative in the hormonal treatment of endometriosis.Title 3:Placebo-controlled comparison of hormonal and biochemical effects of danazol and high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate.Abstract 3:The hormonal and biochemical effects of danazol (600 mg a day) and high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 100 mg a day) were studied in a placebo-controlled, 6-month trial. Serum gonadotrophins and prolactin levels did not change during danazol and MPA treatments, whereas oestradiol and progesterone levels decreased significantly in relation to placebo without any difference between danazol and MPA. Both drugs significantly suppressed the sex hormone-binding globulin level (SHBG), and consequently, the free-androgen index (serum total testosterone nmol/l per SHBG nmol/l x 100) as compared with placebo, the effect of danazol being significantly stronger than that of MPA. Danazol, but not MPA, significantly increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and haemoglobin levels, and also thrombocyte counts, whereas MPA, but not danazol, increased the serum concentration of albumin in relation to placebo. Serum total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, sodium and potassium levels and leucocyte counts remained unchanged during both treatments. Danazol and high-dose MPA did not differ from each other in their ovarian and anterior pituitary effects, while the increase in androgenic activity induced by danazol was greater than that achieved with MPA. Danazol also had more biochemical effects than MPA. It interfered with the functions of the liver and the production of thrombocytes and haemoglobin, whereas MPA affected only albumin synthesis/release.","answer":"Danazol is effective in treating the symptoms and signs of endometriosis. However, its use is limited by the occurrence of androgenic side effects."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In order to optimize the compression, trajectory compression algorithms need to adapt compression ratio subject to the compressibility of the trajectory. Intuitively, the trajectory of an object moving in starlight road is more compressible compared to the trajectory of a object moving in winding roads, therefore, higher compression is achievable in the former case compared to the later. We propose an in-situ compression technique underpinning the support vector regression theory, which accurately predicts the compressibility of a trajectory given the mean speed of the object and then apply compressive sensing to adapt the compression to the compressibility of the trajectory. The conventional encoding and decoding process of compressive sensing uses predefined dictionary and measurement (or projection) matrix pairs. However, the selection of an optimal pair is nontrivial and exhaustive, and random selection of a pair does not guarantee the best compression performance. In this paper, we propose a deterministic and data driven construction for the projection matrix which is obtained by applying singular value decomposition to a sparsifying dictionary learned from the dataset. We analyze case studies of pedestrian and animal trajectory datasets including GPS trajectory data from 127 subjects. The experimental results suggest that the proposed adaptive compression algorithm, incorporating the deterministic construction of projection matrix, offers significantly better compression performance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: Sparse signal representation, analysis, and sensing have received a lot of attention in recent years from the signal processing, optimization, and learning communities. On one hand, learning overcomplete dictionaries that facilitate a sparse representation of the data as a liner combination of a few atoms from such dictionary leads to state-of-the-art results in image and video restoration and classification. On the other hand, the framework of compressed sensing (CS) has shown that sparse signals can be recovered from far less samples than those required by the classical Shannon-Nyquist Theorem. The samples used in CS correspond to linear projections obtained by a sensing projection matrix. It has been shown that, for example, a nonadaptive random sampling matrix satisfies the fundamental theoretical requirements of CS, enjoying the additional benefit of universality. On the other hand, a projection sensing matrix that is optimally designed for a certain class of signals can further improve the reconstruction accuracy or further reduce the necessary number of samples. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the joint design and optimization, from a set of training images, of the nonparametric dictionary and the sensing matrix. We show that this joint optimization outperforms both the use of random sensing matrices and those matrices that are optimized independently of the learning of the dictionary. Particular cases of the proposed framework include the optimization of the sensing matrix for a given dictionary as well as the optimization of the dictionary for a predefined sensing environment. The presentation of the framework and its efficient numerical optimization is complemented with numerous examples on classical image datasets.[3]: Compressed sensing (CS) offers a joint compression and sensing processes, based on the existence of a sparse representation of the treated signal and a set of projected measurements. Work on CS thus far typically assumes that the projections are drawn at random. In this paper, we consider the optimization of these projections. Since such a direct optimization is prohibitive, we target an average measure of the mutual coherence of the effective dictionary, and demonstrate that this leads to better CS reconstruction performance. Both the basis pursuit (BP) and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) are shown to benefit from the newly designed projections, with a reduction of the error rate by a factor of 10 and beyond.","answer":"Elad in [3] and in [2] have optimized projection matrix to achieve better compression ratio. Elad has defined a new mutual coherence, which describes the correlation between the dictionary and projection matrix. The smaller the mutual coherence, the better the compression performance. Elad has minimized the mutual coherence with respect to the projection matrix - keeping the dictionary fixed. In addition to just optimizing the projection matrix, has optimized the dictionary simultaneously. In particular, Julio uses recently proposed K-SVD algorithm proposed in [1] to learn dictionary and then jointly optimize the dictionary and projection matrix by maximizing the number of orthogonal columns in their product. We use SPAMS to learn the dictionary, which is different to K-SVD. In addition, in order to optimize the projection matrix we obtain a special singular value decomposition of the dictionary, which naturally produces low coherence projection matrix and dictionary pair. We contrasted our work with that of Elad's, however, we had difficulties to run Julio's method for our trajectory dataset."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Despite the clinical prevalence of the antidepressant escitalopram, over 30% of escitalopram-treated patients fail to respond to treatment. Recent gene association studies have highlighted a potential link between the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and response to escitalopram. The present studies investigated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between P-gp and escitalopram. In vitro bidirectional transport studies revealed that escitalopram is a transported substrate of human P-gp. Microdialysis-based pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that administration of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporin A resulted in increased brain levels of escitalopram without altering plasma escitalopram levels in the rat , thereby showing that P-gp restricts escitalopram transport across the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) in vivo . The tail suspension test (TST) was carried out to elucidate the pharmacodynamic impact of P-gp inhibition on escitalopram effect in a mouse model of antidepressant activity. Pre-treatment with the P-gp inhibitor verapamil enhanced the response to escitalopram in the TST. Taken together, these data indicate that P-gp may restrict the BBB transport of escitalopram in humans, potentially resulting in subtherapeutic brain concentrations in certain patients. Moreover, by verifying that increasing escitalopram delivery to the brain by P-gp inhibition results in enhanced antidepressant-like activity, we suggest that adjunctive treatment with a P-gp inhibitor may represent a beneficial approach to augment escitalopram therapy in depression.sentence: Microdialysis-based pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that administration of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporin A resulted in increased brain levels of escitalopram without altering plasma escitalopram levels in the rat , thereby showing that P-gp restricts escitalopram transport across the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) in vivo .","answer":"[[\\"cyclosporin\\", \\"escitalopram\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

The R-enantiomer of modafinil might have unique pharmacological properties that should be further investigated. METHODS: (+/-)-Modafinil and its R-(-)- and S-(+)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of [(3)H] dopamine (DA) uptake and [(3)H]WIN 35428 binding in human dopamine transporter (DAT) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. Data were compared with cocaine and the atypical DA uptake inhibitor, JHW 007. R- and S-modafinil were also evaluated in microdialysis studies in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell and in a cocaine discrimination procedure. RESULTS: (+/-)-, R-, and S-modafinil bind to the DAT and inhibit DA uptake less potently than cocaine, with R-modafinil having approximately threefold higher affinity than its S-enantiomer. Molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers. R-modafinil was significantly less potent in the DAT Y156F mutant compared with wild-type DAT, whereas S-modafinil was affected less. Studies with the Y335A DAT mutant showed that the R- and S-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than cocaine, which was further supported by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate reactivity on the DAT E2C I159C. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both R- and S-modafinil produced increases in extracellular DA concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action. Both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. CONCLUSIONS: R-modafinil displays an in vitro profile different from cocaine. Future trials with R-modafinil as a substitute therapy with the potential benefit of cognitive enhancement for psychostimulant addiction are warranted.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"[(3)H]WIN 35428\\", \\"(+/-)-, R-, and S-modafinil\\", \\"[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate\\", \\"R-enantiomer of modafinil\\", \\"JHW 007\\", \\"DA\\", \\"[(3)H] dopamine\\", \\"dopamine\\", \\"armodafinil\\", \\"R-modafinil\\", \\"S-modafinil\\", \\"(+/-)-Modafinil\\", \\"R- and S-modafinil\\", \\"cocaine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Y156F\\", \\"DAT\\", \\"human dopamine transporter\\", \\"I159C\\", \\"Y335A\\", \\"E2C\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

INTRODUCTION: Many substances that form methemoglobin (MHb) effectively counter cyanide (CN) toxicity. Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment. Using this rationale, the 8-aminoquinoline WR242511, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment. METHODS: In this study, WR242511 was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received WR242511 orally (PO) at 7.0 mg/kg. Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure. RESULTS: The selected doses of WR242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. Furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and/or indirect drug-induced toxicity. It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti-CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"8-aminoquinoline\\", \\"WR242511\\", \\"8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"liver and kidney toxicity\\", \\"kidney toxicity\\", \\"Toxicity\\", \\"poisoning\\", \\"methemoglobinemia\\", \\"liver toxicity\\", \\"hemoglobinuria\\", \\"toxicity\\", \\"Myoglobinuria\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

For this purpose nasopharyngeal swab samples from 424 children less than 12 years of age with acute respiratory tract infections were collected over three epidemic seasons and were analysed for the presence of the most common 15 respiratory viruses. A viral pathogen was identified in 86% of the samples, with multiple infections being observed in almost 20% of the samples. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV (30.4%) and Rhinovirus (27.4%). RSV exhibited a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year. While RSV and PIV3 incidence decreased significantly with age, the opposite was observed for influenza A and B as well as adenovirus infections. The data presented expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and will be helpful to the clinicians and researchers interested in the treatment and control of viral respiratory tract infections. Text: Viral Respiratory tract infections (RTI) represent a major public health problem because of their world-wide occurrence, ease of transmission and considerable morbidity and mortality effecting people of all ages. Children are on average infected two to three times more frequently than adults, with acute RTIs being the most common infection in childhood [1, 2] . Illnesses caused by respiratory viruses include, among others, common colds, pharyngitis, croup, bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia and otitis media. Rapid diagnosis is important not only for timely therapeutic intervention but also for the identification of a beginning influenza epidemic and the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic treatment [3, 4] . RTIs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute RTI is most common in children under five years of age, and represents 30-50% of the paediatric medical admissions, as well as 20-40% of hospitalizations in children. Respiratory infections cluster during winter and early spring months . The leading viral agents include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B (INF-A, INF-B) viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and human adenoviruses (HAdVs). In addition, there is a continuously increasing list of new respiratory viruses that contribute significantly to the burden of acute respiratory infections, such as the recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human Bocavirus (HBoV) [5] . Acute RTIs are classified as upper (UTRIs) and lower RTI (LRTIs), according to the involved anatomic localization. URTIs cause non-severe but widespread epidemics that are responsible for continuous circulation of pathogens in the community. LRTIs have been classified as frank pneumonia and bronchiolitis with clinical, radiological and etiological features that usually overlap [6, 7] . Viruses are again the foremost agents of LRTIs often misdiagnosed as bacterial in origin and hence treated with antibiotics unnecessarily [8] . The main aim of this study was to determine the aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and assess the epidemiology of the identified viral pathogens over three epidemic seasons. The study was approved by the Cyprus National Bioethics Committee. Accordingly, written informed consent was obtained from parents prior to sample taking. Between November 2010 and October 2013, 485 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children up to 12 years of age, who had been hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection at the Archbishop Makarios III hospital, Nicosia. Clinical and demographic information including symptoms, duration of hospitalisation, diagnosis and treatment were recorded. Nasal swab samples were collected using the BD Universal Viral Transport Collection Kit. Viral RNA/DNA was extracted from 400 μl sample using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification instrument (Invitrogen). A set of four multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR assays was established and validated for the detection of the 15 most common respiratory viruses as follows: assay 1: influenzaviruses A and B, RSV, assay 2: parainfluenzaviruses 1-4, assay 3: HAdV, enteroviruses, HMPV and HBoV and assay 4: rhinoviruses and the human coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E (Table 1) . Published primer and probe sets were used as a basis for designing the assays, however, all primer/probe sequences were checked against newly build sequence alignments of all viruses tested and were modified, if necessary, to account for possible sequence variations. For this purpose, all available complete genome sequences were obtained for each virus from GenBank, imported into the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor v7.1.7 and aligned using ClustalX. In case of mismatches between published primers/probe and target sequences, modifications were applied, as indicated in Table 1 . The alignments for the viruses, which necessitated changes to the primers/probe are available in Fasta-Format as supplement S1-S4 Files. Primer concentrations and reaction conditions for the four assays were subsequently optimised for multiplexing. In order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, the laboratory enrolled for two consecutive years in Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) external quality assessment schemes for all viruses, except Bocavirus, which was unavailable. In summary, the established assays were able to correctly identify all viruses tested, proving their suitability for diagnostic application. A possible correlation of virus prevalence and age of infection was assessed using univariate analyses. The Fisher's exact test was used where cell counts below 5 were encountered; otherwise, the chi-squared test was performed. The same statistical tests were used to compare the frequency of subjects with single or multiple infections between age groups. In addition, Pearson correlation was used to examine co-infections of different viruses. All statistical analyses were performed using StataSE 12 (StatCorp. 2007. College Station, TX, USA). The present study was a prospective investigation of children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections between November 2010 and October 2013 in Cyprus. The median age of the children was 15 months (range: 0-140 months) with 243 being male and 181 female (male/ female ratio 1.34). The age distribution is shown in Fig 1. Out of the 424 samples analysed, 364 (85.8%) were positive for one or more viruses. Results are summarized in Table 2 .The most commonly detected viruses were RSV, which was found in 129 (30.4%) patients and rhinoviruses in 116 (27.4%) accounting together for almost 60% of all detections. With moderate frequency have been detected HAdV in 31(7.3%) patients, influenza A in 28 (6.6%), HBoV in 24 (5.7%), enteroviruses and PIV 3 in 23 (5.4%) of patients respectively, and Influenza B in 21 (5.0%). A low frequency was exhibited by HMPV with 16 (3.8%) positive samples, human coronavirus OC43 with 13 (3.1%), PIV 1 with 12 (2.8%), PIV 4 with 9 (2.1%), PIV 2 with 7 (1.7%) and HCoV NL63 with 6 (1.4%). Coronavirus 229E could be detected only in a single sample. Co-infections with two or more viruses were observed in 84 out of the 364 positive samples (see Table 2 ). Dual infections accounted for 17% of all positive samples and three viruses were detected in 2.7% of samples). A single patient sample displayed a quadruple infection being simultaneously positive for RSV, rhinovirus, HBoV and influenza B. Table 3 summarizes the frequency of each virus in single vs. multiple infections as well as the number of co-occurrences of viruses for each possible virus combination. In absolute terms the most common combination observed was RSV/rhinovirus. As a percentage, however, the virus appearing most often in co- infections was HBoV, which was found in more than 70% of cases together with another virus, followed by coronaviruses HCoV OC43 and HCoV NL63 with 61% and 67%, respectively. On the other hand, the viruses most rarely seen in co-infections were influenza viruses A and B as well as RSV. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the likelihood of co-infections of different viruses. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 1 in S1 Table. Significant correlation (P-value < 0.05) was seen mostly for co-infections with RSV, however correlations were very weak (r<0.3) and negative. This finding can probably be explained by the fact that RSV infections occurred predominantly in the very young, where co-infections were less frequently observed. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation was observed for enterovirus and rhinovirus co-infection hinting maybe at similarities in circulation patterns and/or transmission modes. Regarding seasonality, different patterns of circulations could be observed for RSV, rhinoviruses and influenzaviruses (A and B combined) (Fig 2) , with RSV and influenza exhibiting a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year. However, as more than 100 different rhinovirus strains have been identified to be circulating worldwide in parallel and successively, a potential seasonality of individual rhinovirus serotypes may be masked by overlapping patterns [18, 19] . The data was further analysed with regard to the age distribution of virus infection (see Table 2 ). In infants up to 3 months old, RSV was by far the most common pathogen (58.1%), followed by rhinovirus (20.3%) and PIV3 with 8.1% each. The incidence of RSV, however, decreases significantly with increasing age (p-value < 0.0001) dropping to 13% in children older than 3 years old, while the reverse relationship is observed for Influenza A and B and HAdV. Rhinoviruses, HBoV and enteroviruses are most frequently observed in children from 4 months to 3 years of age. The age dependency of the virus incidence is visualized in Fig 3 for the seven most frequently observed viruses. The positivity rate also showed a trend according to the age group dropping from 90.5% in the under 3-month old to 78.3% in the 4-12 years old (p-value = 0.020). This may point to an increasing role of pathogens not included in the assays, such as bacterial infections in older children. Regarding multiple infections, children less than 3 month of age and those older than 4 years had a significantly smaller risk to present with multiple infections as compared to the other two age groups (p-value = 0.014). A reason for this could be that very young children have limited contact to others reducing thereby the chance for a co-infection, whereas children older than 3 years already established immunity to an increasing number of viruses encountered previously. This study for the first time examined the aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children in Cyprus. Four multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR assays were developed in order to detect the most common respiratory viral pathogens in a fast and cost-effective way. The high rate of positive samples (85.8%) is evidence of the high sensitivity of the Multiplex-assays used and that the range of viruses included in the analysis is comprehensive. Many previous studies have shown detection rates ranging from below 50% to 75% [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The most common viruses detected were RSV and rhinovirus accounting for almost 60% of all cases. Both viruses were reported previously by others as the major aetiology for respiratory viral infections in young children with rhinoviruses being recognized increasingly for their role in lower respiratory tract infections [20, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Our data support the results of similar studies performed in the Middle East region. A recently published study found that RSV was the most commonly detected virus in nasopharyngeal swabs from children presenting symptoms of RTIs and in addition to that it also showed that RSV infections follow a similar circulation pattern peaking from December to March [31] . Another study has revealed that RSV and PIV3 incidence decreases significantly with age, whereas the opposite is observed for influenza and adenovirus infections, a trend that was also observed in our study [26] . Mixed infections were observed in approximately 20% of all samples, which is in the middle of previously reported rates ranging from 10 to almost 40%. HBoV, HCoV and EV were found most frequently in co-infections. All three subtypes of HCoV were co-detected with several other viruses, while HBoV was co-detected mainly with HRV and RSV. In the case of EV infections, EV were almost predominantly associated with HRV. The rare presence of InfA and InfB viruses in multiple infections witnessed in our study was also observed elsewhere [32, 33] . Even though this study did not allow for investigating a possible association between multiple infections and disease severity, a review of the literature shows that such a potential association is still subject to controversy, since there are reports showing no relationship of multiple virus infection with respiratoty illness severity on one hand or a significant association on the other. Studies have shown that viral co-infection was significantly associated with longer duration of illness symptoms, but with a decreased severity in hospitalized children regarding oxygen requirement and intensive care unit admission, whereas the findings of other studies have indicated that severe clinical phenotypes were more prevalent in co-infection patients, especially in RSV co-infections that may increase the severity of RSV associated disease in children [25, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Viral respiratory infections continue to be a worldwide health concern. As the clinical symptoms of patients with acute respiratory tract infections do usually not allow a discrimination of viral or bacterial aetiology, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are required for better antibiotic stewardship and the implementation of appropriate infection control measures [4, 41] . The data presented expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and will be helpful to the clinicians and researchers interested in the treatment and control of viral respiratory tract infections.Question: When do respiratory infections usually happen?","answer":"during winter and early spring months"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Here we show that miR-133a, a microRNA that is expressed in both BAT and SATs, directly targets the 3′ UTR of Prdm16. The expression of miR-133a dramatically decreases along the commitment and differentiation of brown preadipocytes, accompanied by the upregulation of Prdm16. Overexpression of miR-133a in BAT and SAT cells significantly inhibits, and conversely inhibition of miR-133a upregulates, Prdm16 and brown adipogenesis. More importantly, double knockout of miR-133a1 and miR-133a2 in mice leads to elevations of the brown and thermogenic gene programs in SAT. Even 75% deletion of miR-133a( a1−/−a2+/−) genes results in browning of SAT, manifested by the appearance of numerous multilocular UCP1-expressing adipocytes within SAT. Additionally, compared to wildtype mice, miR-133a1−/−a2+/− mice exhibit increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and activate the thermogenic gene program more robustly upon cold exposure. These results together elucidate a crucial role of miR-133a in the regulation of adipocyte browning in vivo.Introduction:Adipose tissues are classified as brown( BAT) and white( WAT), and an intermediate category of “brite” or “beige” adipocytes exist within subcutaneous WAT[1],[2]. WAT are located in multiple subcutaneous or visceral locations of body, in the form of distinct fat depots, and contribute to overweight, obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Brown adipocytes contain more mitochondria and express high levels of Ucp1, a mitochondria inner-membrane channel uncoupling ATP production with oxidative phosphorylation, therefore producing heat and dissipating chemical energy. Due to the global concern of obesity, browning of the white adipocytes, the induction of white adipocytes into beige adipocytes, has become a research focus. The signaling pathway that determines the developmental commitment and differentiation of brown and beige adipocytes is therefore crucial for understanding the process and importance of adipose browning. Prdm16 is a critical regulator of brown adipocyte development and determines the thermogenic gene program in SAT. Downregulation of Prdm16 in brown adipocytes promotes their fate switch to myoblasts[3]. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of Prdm16 and its co-activator C/EBPβ in myoblasts or fibroblasts transdifferentiated them into brown adipocytes[3],[4]. Similarly, overexpression of Prdm16 in the stromal vascular fraction( SVF) cells of SAT led to the browning of white adipocytes[5]. Mechanistic studies have shown that Type 2 diabetic drug Rosiglitazone can stabilize Prdm16 protein, which activates PPARγ2 and initiates a brown adipocyte gene program that converts white adipocytes to beige adipocytes[6]. The signals that regulate Prdm16 transcription and post-transcriptional modification may offer new strategies for clinical applications and drug discoveries. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate mRNA stability or protein translation through targeting the 3′untranslated regions( UTR) of mature mRNA. Previous studies have demonstrated that several myogenic microRNAs( i. e. miR-1, miR-206 and miR-133) are enriched in BAT in relative to WAT[7]. In addition, the cluster of miR-193b and miR-365, downstream signals of Prdm16, are required for brown adipocyte differentiation[8]. Moreover, miR-196a mediates the browning of white adipocytes through targeting Hoxc8, a repressor of brown adipogenic marker C/EBPβ[9]. These studies indicate that microRNAs play important roles in brown adipose development and the browning of white adipocytes. In the present study, we examined the expression of over 30 microRNAs in the anterior subcutaneous WAT( asWAT) and inguinal WAT( ingWAT) that expressed relatively low and high levels of Prdm16, respectively. We identified several microRNAs whose expression is inversely correlated to Prdm16 expression. Based on this discovery, we conducted gain- and loss- of function studies to demonstrate that miR-133a regulates brown adipocyte biogenesis and browning of white adipocytes through the repression of Prdm16. Analysis of miR-133a knockout mice confirmed the in vivo function of this microRNA in regulating the adaptive plasticity of white adipocytes. We conclude that miR-133a plays a repressive role in adipocyte browning.Discussion:We identified miR-133a as a regulator of Prdm16 in vivo. Based on the mutual exclusion model of miRNA-mRNA interactions, the cells that express high levels of miRNAs should have less expression of their targets, and vice versa[16]. However, we found both miR-133a and Prdm16 are expressed at very high levels in BAT compared to WAT. This paradox led us to hypothesize that within the BAT, there are different populations of cells that express high levels of miR-133a or Prdm16, respectively, with the notion that miR-133a is highly expressed in cells expressing low levels of Prdm16, and vice versa. In the course of brown adipocyte commitment and differentiation, aP2 expression marks more committed progenitors and preadipocytes, whereas aP2− cells contain more primitive adipocyte progenitors, mesenchymal stem cells and other cell types[12]. Compared to the more primitive cells( aP2−), aP2+ cells express increased Prdm16 and decreased miR-133a. Orchestrated with this notion is the observation that compared to APCs, differentiated brown adipocytes nearly lost the expression of miR-133a. These data imply that miR-133a-mediated Prdm16 repression occurs mainly in uncommitted stem cells to restrict their differentiation towards brown fat, and maintain their multipotency. The luciferase reporter assay, gain- and loss-of-function studies provide direct evidence that miR-133a target Prdm16. In consistency with our study, two recent studies demonstrated that miR-133 can target Prdm16 in both satellite cells and brown adipose cell lines[17],[18]. Interestingly, miR-133a dKO mouse has adipocyte browning in SAT but has no overt phenotype in BAT. Several possibilities might have led to this observation. First, miR-133b, another miR-133 family member, is also highly expressed in BAT( than in WAT) and maintains its expression in the miR-133a dKO BAT. Notably, miR-133b is dramatically downregulated in the asWAT and ingWAT of miR-133a dKO mice for unknown reasons. The loss of both miR-133a and miR-133b in SAT might have led to the upregulation of Prdm16 and activation of the BAT and thermogenic gene program. Second, the loss of miR-133a may be insufficient to further upregulate Prdm16, which is already highly expressed in the BAT. By contrast, Prdm16 is expressed at levels several fold lower in the SAT and the loss of miR-133a can therefore lead to an upregulation of Prdm16. It has been reported that 76% of miR-133a1−/−a2−/− dKO mice die prior to P10 and the few surviving mice are subjected to sudden death due to cardiomyopathy[13]. Due to the extremely low survival rate of the miR-133a1−/−a2−/− dKO mice[13],[14], we used miR-133a1−/−a2+/− that had three out of the four miR-133a alleles knocked for most in vivo studies. We found that the ingWAT of miR-133a1−/−a2+/− mice contains numerous multilocular adipocytes that express UCP1. Our observation that beige adipocyte specific CD137 and Tmem26 genes are highly upregulated in the miR-133a1−/−a2+/− compared to the wildtype ingWAT suggests that the multilocular adipocytes in the miR-133a1−/−a2+/− WAT are probably the cold-inducible adaptive beige adipocytes. Consistent with this notion, we found that miR-133a1−/−a2+/− mice activate the thermogenic gene program much more robustly than the wildtype mice upon cold exposure. More importantly, ITT and GTT demonstrate that the miR-133a1−/−a2+/− mice exhibit increased sensitivity to insulin and glucose tolerance compared to WT controls. These results together provide strong in vivo evidence that miR-133a regulates the normal physiological function of adipose tissues. Upon catecholamine hormone stimulations, WAT depots undergo lipid mobilization, a lipolysis process that hydrolyzes triglycerides of white adipocytes[19]. Free fatty acids released from white adipocyte lipolysis undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria of brown adipose tissue and provide energy. The Fatty acids also activate special Pparγ2 complex which directly activates Ucp1 expression and dissipates chemical energy[20]. Prdm16 is a Pparγ2 coactivator that drives the brown adipocyte gene program[3]. Here we showed that miR-133a inhibits white adipocyte browning, it would be interesting to study if miR-133a is involved in the repression of hormone stimulated adipocyte browning process. Obesity has disrupted catecholamine signals, leading to excess fat accumulation and multiple metabolic diseases[19]. Prdm16 drives expression of the browning and thermogenic gene program[2],[5]. Overexpression of Prdm16 in adipose lineage resulted in large number of beige cell formation in SAT and more energy expenditure, which improved glucose metabolism and enhanced insulin sensitivity[2]. However, there is no report to show the anti-obese and anti-diabetic role of Prdm16, or adipocyte browning, in obese and diabetic background. It would be interesting to examine if overexpression of Prdm16 in the ob/ob mice or the db/db mice can ameliorate excessive fat accumulation and improve system insulin sensitivity. In this study we showed that miR-133a negatively regulates Prdm16 and miR-133a KO mice have dramatic phenotype including adipocyte browning, improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Consistent with our observation, blockage of endogenous miR133 by antisense nucleotides in mice can greatly lower blood glucose levels[18]. It remains to be investigated if inhibition of miR-133a can increase system energy expenditure in the ob/ob and db/db background. Interscapular brown adipose is detectable in the newborn humans to maintain body temperature but its mass gradually decreases in the postnatal life[21]. Recent studies have demonstrated that adult humans develop active brown adipocytes in response to cold exposure and the amount of BAT is inversely correlated with body weight[22],[23],[24]. Detailed molecular signature analysis suggested that the adult human brown adipocytes are more similar to murine beige cells, but not the classical interscapular BAT cells[15],[25]. Our study revealed that miR-133a represses white adipocyte browning and beige adipocyte formation in the mouse model. It remains to be investigated if miR-133a also plays a crucial role in the naturally occurred adipocyte browning in humans. As the increased beige adipocytes absorb more glucose and increase insulin sensitivity, it will be interesting to investigate if miR-133a could be a potent drug target for clinical purposes.","answer":"Global obesity and associated health issues have raised the significance of adipocyte biology .

Liver is a vital organ and plays a major role in metabolism with numerous functions. Information concerning the dynamic patterns of mRNA m6A methylation during postnatal development of liver has been long overdue and elucidation of this information will benefit for further deciphering a multitude of functional outcomes of mRNA m6A methylation. Here, we profile transcriptome -wide m6A in porcine liver at three developmental stages: newborn (0 day), suckling (21 days) and adult (2 years). About 33% of transcribed genes were modified by m6A, with 1.33 to 1.42 m6A peaks per modified gene. m6A was distributed predominantly around stop codons. The consensus motif sequence RRm6ACH was observed in 78.90% of m6A peaks. A negative correlation (average Pearson's r = -0.45, P < 10-16) was found between levels of m6A methylation and gene expression. Functional enrichment analysis of genes consistently modified by m6A methylation at all three stages showed genes relevant to important functions, including regulation of growth and development, regulation of metabolic processes and protein catabolic processes. Genes with higher m6A methylation and lower expression levels at any particular stage were associated with the biological processes required for or unique to that stage. We suggest that differential m6A methylation may be important for the regulation of nutrient metabolism in porcine liver.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"organ\\", \\"transcribed genes\\", \\"Genes\\", \\"genes\\", \\"gene\\", \\"Liver\\", \\"protein coding gene\\", \\"liver\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"biological processes\\", \\"protein catabolic processes\\", \\"methylation\\", \\"metabolism\\", \\"epigenetic RNA modification\\", \\"expression\\", \\"deciphering\\", \\"regulation\\", \\"regulation of post-transcriptional\\", \\"gene expression\\", \\"regulation of growth\\", \\"metabolic processes\\", \\"development\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"mRNA\\", \\"N6-methyladenosine\\", \\"m6A\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"pig\\", \\"newborn\\", \\"suckling\\", \\"porcine\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"negative\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"nutrient\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"profile\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"analysis\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"patterns\\", \\"stop codons\\", \\"transcriptome\\", \\"RRm6ACH\\", \\"consensus motif sequence\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Multi-layer Caching 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  In the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), caching is a very promising technique to mitigate the transmission burden and to improve consumers' Quality of Experience (QoE) in terms of latency. Determining caching placement policy is one of the most important issues to maximize the caching gain. In this paper, based on the cloud-based VANET architecture and the corresponding content retrieve process, a caching placement policy which jointly considers the caching at the vehicular layer and roadside unit (RSU) layer is proposed. More specifically, the caching placement problem is modeled as an optimization problem to minimize the average latency while satisfying the QoE requirements of vehicles, and the problem is solved effectively via convex optimization and Stimulated Anneal (SA) methods. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme performs better than the existing caching schemes. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Along with modern wireless networks being content-centric, the demand for rich multimedia services has been growing at a tremendous pace, which brings significant challenges to mobile networks in terms of the need for massive content delivery. Edge caching has emerged as a promising approach to alleviate the heavy burden on data transmission through caching and forwarding contents at the edge of networks. However, existing studies always treat storage and computing resources separately, and neglect the mobility characteristic of both the content caching nodes and end users. Driven by these issues, in this work, we propose a new cooperative edge caching architecture for 5G networks, where mobile edge computing resources are utilized for enhancing edge caching capability. In the architecture, we focus on mobility-aware hierarchical caching, where smart vehicles are taken as collaborative caching agents for sharing content cache tasks with base stations. To further utilize the caching resource of smart vehicles, we introduce a new vehicular caching cloud concept, and propose a vehicle-aided edge caching scheme, where the caching and computing resources at the wireless network edge are jointly scheduled. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme minimizes content access latency and improves caching resource utilization.Literature Review:","answer":"In VEC, in order to improve resource utilization, any devices with storage space are potential caching nodes. In other words, contents are allowed to be cached in at different layers, including BSs, RSUs and vehicles if they have storage resources. Caching contents at different layers is beneficial for increasing the availability of contents being successfully accessed by users on move BIB001 . Thus, an advanced caching policy should take full advantage of different layers to achieve optimal performance. In BIB002 , the caching placement is investigated to take into account both of vehicular layer and RSU layer, aimed to minimize the delay while satisfying the QoE of users. The work BIB003 investigates a mobility-aware caching framework for vehicular uses, where vehicles are used to provide content sharing with Base Stations (BSs). Frequent disconnections caused by high mobility of vehicles make it difficult to provide and maintain the QoS of video streaming applications. Thus, the proposed caching scheme in BIB001 considers both of the mobility of nodes and the link disconnection. In this proposed scheme, two metrics of Load Utilization Ratio (LUR) and Query to Connectivity Ratio (QCR) are designed to maintain the QoS."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

Recently, AutoAugment has been proposed as an algorithm to automatically search for augmentation policies from a dataset and has significantly enhanced performances on many image recognition tasks. However, its search method requires thousands of GPU hours even for a relatively small dataset. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Fast AutoAugment that finds effective augmentation policies via a more efficient search strategy based on density matching. In comparison to AutoAugment, the proposed algorithm speeds up the search time by orders of magnitude while achieves comparable performances on image recognition tasks with various models and datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: With recent progress in graphics, it has become more tractable to train models on synthetic images, potentially avoiding the need for expensive annotations. However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulators output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a self-regularization term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.[2]: Data augmentation is an essential part of the training process applied to deep learning models. The motivation is that a robust training process for deep learning models depends on large annotated datasets, which are expensive to be acquired, stored and processed. Therefore a reasonable alternative is to be able to automatically generate new annotated training samples using a process known as data augmentation. The dominant data augmentation approach in the field assumes that new training samples can be obtained via random geometric or appearance transformations applied to annotated training samples, but this is a strong assumption because it is unclear if this is a reliable generative model for producing new training samples. In this paper, we provide a novel Bayesian formulation to data augmentation, where new annotated training points are treated as missing variables and generated based on the distribution learned from the training set. For learning, we introduce a theoretically sound algorithm --- generalised Monte Carlo expectation maximisation, and demonstrate one possible implementation via an extension of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Classification results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show the better performance of our proposed method compared to the current dominant data augmentation approach mentioned above --- the results also show that our approach produces better classification results than similar GAN models.[3]: A recurring problem faced when training neural networks is that there is typically not enough data to maximize the generalization capability of deep neural networks. There are many techniques to address this, including data augmentation, dropout, and transfer learning. In this paper, we introduce an additional method, which we call smart augmentation and we show how to use it to increase the accuracy and reduce over fitting on a target network. Smart augmentation works, by creating a network that learns how to generate augmented data during the training process of a target network in a way that reduces that networks loss. This allows us to learn augmentations that minimize the error of that network. Smart augmentation has shown the potential to increase accuracy by demonstrably significant measures on all data sets tested. In addition, it has shown potential to achieve similar or improved performance levels with significantly smaller network sizes in a number of tested cases.[4]: We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to ½ everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.","answer":"Naturally, automatically finding data augmentation methods from data in principle has emerged to overcome the performance limitation that originated from a cumbersome exploration of methods by a human. Smart Augmentation [3] introduced a network that learns to generate augmented data by merging two or more samples in the same class. [1] employed a generative adversarial network (GAN) [4] to generate images that augment datasets. Bayesian DA [2] combined Monte Carlo expectation maximization algorithm with GAN to generate data by treating augmented data as missing data points on the distribution of the training set."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The subjects, 45 male, metropolitan policemen who were considered at least 20 percent over their optimum body weights, were placed on diets and received weekly instruction on topics of nutrition and exercise. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, one that participated in aerobic conditioning and one that did not. The amount of oxygen consumption, as an index of physical fitness, and performance on selected subscales of the Tennessee Self-concept Scale (TSCS) were measured before and after the training and conditioning programs. Both groups displayed significant increases in oxygen consumption and on the Physical Self and Self-satisfaction subscales, but on all these measures, the Conditioning Group increased significantly (2 to 3 times) more. For both groups, the Total Variability measure from the TSCS showed significant reductions, which have been associated with personality integration. These results demonstrate that physical conditioning and dietary educational sessions or educational sessions alone are associated with positive changes in self-concept in obese individuals and also corroborate other studies that show links between physical and psychological fitness.Title 2:Helping police officers to cope with stress: a cognitive--behavioral approach.Abstract 2:Police Academy trainees participated in a stress management program which focused on developing skills for coping with anxiety and anger. Stress management training took place in six 2-hour sessions and included instruction and practice in the self-monitoring of reactions to stressful situations, muscular relaxation, and the development of adaptive self-statements. Self-report measures of anxiety and anger were obtained before and after the stress management program. In addition, self and observer ratings of trainees' performance in stressful simulated police activities were utilized as posttreatment dependent measures. In comparison to a control group of trainees, the performance of the treatment group was rated, by academy personnel, as superior in several of the simulated police activities. The results of the present study suggest that stress management with law enforcement officers may be most effective when the program focuses on the specific situations which are likely to be encountered by trainees. Limitations of the present program are examined and suggestions for future efforts with law enforcement personnel are discussed.Title 3:Psychological and physical benefits of circuit weight training in law enforcement personnel.Abstract 3:The effects of circuit weight training on mood, perceived stress, job satisfaction, and physical symptoms were investigated in a sample of state law enforcement officers. Forty-three male officers who were not regularly exercising were assigned to either 4 months of circuit weight training or a wait-list control condition. Four months of circuit weight training led to a significant increase in strength on cardiovascular fitness. Subjects also demonstrated significant improvements in mood, including decreases in somatization, anxiety, depression, and hostility. Circuit weight training also resulted in a decrease in reports of physical symptoms and in improvements in job satisfaction. Results indicated that subjects who dropped out of the exercise training program evidenced significantly greater anxiety, depression, and hostility at pretreatment than subjects who completed the program. These findings suggest that circuit weight training programs may contribute to important psychological benefits.","answer":"There is evidence only from individual small and low quality trials with minimal data suggesting that police officers benefit from psychosocial interventions, in terms of physical symptoms and psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, cynicism, anger, PTSD, marital problems and distress.

Vimentin was expressed preferentially in tumor cells of high-grade ductal breast carcinomas (15 of 28 histologic grade 3 vs. 0 of 40 grades 1 and 2). Vimentin expression was found preferentially in tumors with high GF (greater than 15% Ki-67 positive by immunoperoxidase staining) and low ER levels (less than 60 fmols/mg protein by a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay). Sixty-eight percent of tumors in this group were vimentin positive and 88% of all vimentin-positive tumors fell into this category. More than 50% of the tumor cells coexpressed vimentin and keratin. Thus, vimentin expression may be helpful in identifying a substantial subset of ER-independent breast carcinomas with poor prognostic indicators.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"tumor cells\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"primary breast carcinomas\\", \\"breast carcinomas\\", \\"high-grade ductal breast carcinomas\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Cognitive deficit is a core of schizophrenia and it is not effectively treated by the available antipsychotic drugs, hence new and more effective therapy is needed. Schizophrenia is considered as a pathway disorder where Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is important molecular player that regulates multiple cellular cascades. We recently reported synergistic action between phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as DISC1 interacting proteins. In the current study we characterized behavioural effects of a newly developed compound, VP1.15 that inhibits both PDE7 and GSK-3 with main focus on its antipsychotic and cognitive capacities. VP1.15 reduced ambulation in C57BL/6J mice in a dose-dependent manner (7.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively) and, hence, lower dose was chosen for the further analysis. VP1.1.5 facilitated pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), reversed amphetamine- but not MK-801-induced PPI deficit. The drug was able to ameliorate the disrupted latent inhibition (LI) induced by the increased number of conditioning trials and reversed amphetamine-induced LI deficit, supporting further its antipsychotic effects. The drug also significantly improved episodic memory in the spatial object recognition test, facilitated working memory in Y-maze and enhanced cued fear memory, but had no effect on executive function in the Puzzle box and contextual fear conditioning. Taken together, VP1.15 elicited antipsychotic effects and also facilitated cognitive domains in mice, suggesting that multitarget drugs, affecting molecular substrates from the same pathway, perhaps could be antipsychotics of new-generation that open a new possibilities in drug discoveries.

[ cols=\\"<,>,>,^\\",options=\\"header \\" , ]     a selection of estimates for hlbl is presented in table  [ tab : hlbl_summary ] .note that the refs .@xcite are the only full calculations of hlbl to date , using , as much as possible , one model for all the contributions ( hls model in ref .@xcite , extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( enjl ) model in ref .both calculations showed that the exchanges of the lightest pseudoscalar states , @xmath7 , dominate numerically , which can be understood from the large-@xmath8 counting .the contributions from the ( dressed ) pion - loop and the ( dressed ) quark - loop are subdominant , but not negligible , and they happen to largely cancel each other numerically .the final results for the total hlbl contribution were rather close in both models . in ref .@xcite an ansatz for the pion - photon transition form factor with a minimal number of narrow vector resonances in large-@xmath8 qcd ( lowest meson dominance ( lmd , lmd+v ) ) was matched to short - distance constraints from the ope .the reevaluation of the pion - pole contribution to hlbl in ref .@xcite with the ansatz from ref .@xcite then revealed a sign error in the earlier calculations  @xcite .furthermore , for the neutral pion contribution , a 2-dimensional integral representation was derived in ref .@xcite for a certain class of vector meson dominance ( vmd)-like form factors . in the end , one integrates over the lengths of the two independent loop - momenta @xmath9 in euclidean space .schematically , @xmath10 with universal weight functions @xmath11 and where the ( model ) dependence on the form factors resides in the functions @xmath12 , see ref .@xcite for details .note that the expressions in ref .@xcite with on - shell form factors are in general not valid as they stand . as pointed out in ref .@xcite , one needs to set the form factor at the external vertex to a constant to obtain the pion-_pole  _ contribution .but the expressions are valid for the constant wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) form factor and the off - shell vmd form factor .the weight functions @xmath11 are plotted in figure  [ fig:2d_weightfunctions ] .one can see that the relevant momentum regions are about @xmath13 , see also the numerical analysis in ref .as long as the form factors in different models lead to a damping , we expect comparable results for @xmath14 at the level of 20% , which is indeed the case , see the papers quoted in table  [ tab : hlbl_summary ] and ref .@xcite . for the general case with off - shell form factors ,a 3-dimensional integral representation was derived in ref .@xcite , where the integrations run over @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .     in eq .( [ 2d_integral ] ) from ref .@xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    later , ref .@xcite derived new short - distance constraints from the four - point function on the pion - pole and axial - vector - pole contributions , which do not allow for any form factors at the external vertex .reference  @xcite also included the mixing of two axial - vector nonets and studied the pion - loop within the hls model in more detail .all this lead to a substantial enhancement of these contributions to hlbl .more recently , a new short - distance constraint on the off - shell form factor at the external vertex in pion - exchange was derived in ref .@xcite , which yielded , again in the framework of the lowest meson dominance approximation to large-@xmath8 qcd , a value for this contribution about half - way between the results in refs .@xcite and those in ref .note that the compilations  @xcite and ref .@xcite are largely based on the full calculations  @xcite , with revised or newly calculated values for some of the contributions .more recent estimates , mostly for the pseudoscalar contribution , can be found in ref .while most of these evaluations agree at the level of 15% , if one takes the extreme values , there is a spread of @xmath18 .    until 2010, a consensus had been reached about the central value @xmath19 , but there was a discussion on how to estimate the error , more progressively , @xmath20 , in ref .@xcite and more conservatively , @xmath21 , in refs .@xcite . in view of the precision goal of future @xmath0 experiments at fermilab and j - parc  @xcite with @xmath22 and the continued progress in improving the error in hvp, the hlbl contribution might soon be the main uncertainty in the theory prediction , if it can not be brought under better control  @xcite .    in the last few years, several works have appeared which yield much larger ( absolute ) values for some of the contributions , see table  [ tab : hlbl_summary ] . in ref .@xcite the quark - loop was studied using a dyson - schwinger equation approach .in contrast to refs .@xcite , no damping compared to the bare constituent quark - loop result was seen , when a dressing was included .note that this calculation of the quark - loop is not yet complete and that earlier , very large results for the quark - loop seem to have been affected by some errors in the numerics in certain parts .the large size of the quark - loop contribution in ref .@xcite was questioned in the papers  @xcite , using different quark - models and approaches , see also the ballpark prediction for hlbl in ref .the pion - loop contribution was analyzed in ref .the authors stressed the importance of the pion - polarizability effect and the role of the axial - vector resonance @xmath23 , which are not included in the models used in refs .@xcite . depending on the value of the pion - polarizability and the model for the @xmath23 resonanceused , a large variation was seen .the issue was taken up in ref .@xcite where different models for the pion - loop were studied .the inclusion of the @xmath23 resonance was attempted , but no finite result for @xmath0 could be achieved . with a cutoff of @xmath4 , a result close to the earlier estimate in ref .@xcite was obtained .reference  @xcite also pointed out that the very small ( absolute ) value for the pion - loop in ref .@xcite could be due to the fact that the hls model used in ref .@xcite has a wrong high - energy behavior and that there is some cancellation between positive and negative contributions in the pion - loop in hlbl .concerning the future , maybe lattice qcd will provide a reliable calculation of hlbl at some point , see ref .@xcite for some promising recent results . in the meantime, only a close collaboration between theory and experiment can lead to a better controlled estimate for hlbl . on the theory side ,the hadronic models can be improved by short - distance constraints from perturbative qcd to have a better matching at high momenta .one can also use dispersion relations to connect the theory with experimental data , e.g. in @xmath24  @xcite .also the issue about whether the dressing of the bare constituent quark - loop leads to a suppression or an enhancement needs to be studied further .this problem is also related to the question whether there is any double counting involved .    on the experimental side ,the information on various processes ( decays , form factors , cross - sections ) of hadrons interacting with photons at low and intermediate momenta , @xmath25 , can help to constrain the models .important experiments which should be pursued include more precise measurements of the ( transition ) form factors of light pseudoscalars with possibly two off - shell photons in the process @xmath26 and the two - photon decay width and the ( double ) dalitz decays of these mesons .this could further reduce the error of the dominant pseudoscalar exchange contribution  @xcite . concerning the pion - loop contribution , in addition to studying @xmath27 , measurements of the pion - polarizability in various processes , e.g.  in radiative pion decay @xmath28 , in radiative pion photoproduction @xmath29 or with the hadronic primakoff effect @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( with some nucleus @xmath32 ) , can help to improve the models  @xcite . for the development of models with the axial - vector resonance @xmath23 and estimates of the sizable axial - vector contribution , information about the decays @xmath33 would be useful as well .finally , to extract the needed quantities from experiment will also require the development of dedicated monte carlo programs for the relevant processes  @xcite .if the recent results for the quark - loop and pion - loop are taken at face value , one obtains the range @xmath34 .while the new approaches raise some important issues and point to potential shortcomings in the previously used models , these calculations are also still preliminary and further studies are needed .therefore , the estimate @xmath35 from refs .@xcite still seems to give a fair description of the current situation .i would like to thank the organizers of the _ international workshop on @xmath36 collisions from @xmath37 to @xmath38 2013 ( phipsi13 ) _ , of the _ working group on radiative corrections and monte carlo generators for low energies _ and of the _lc13 workshop : exploring qcd from the infrared regime to heavy flavour scales at b -

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense single stranded RNA enveloped virus causing chronic hepatitis in most untreated patients (about 80%), with the consequent risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. More than 170 million people (2%-3% of the world population) are infected worldwide, and a protective vaccine is not yet available, whereas therapeutic options are still limited and not completely effective [19] . For these reasons chronic HCV infection represents the major indication for liver transplantation in Europe and United States. Moreover, transplanted recipients are subject to high risk of graft re-infection and to a more severe and rapid progression of the liver disease [20] . Schematic representation of viral escape mechanisms from humoral immune response against surface viral proteins: point mutations on immunodominant regions, glycosylation of functionally pivotal residues (glycan shield) of the viral surface proteins and virus association with host serum components (e.g., lipoproteins) (B) Mechanisms of interference on nAb-mediated virus neutralization by the binding of interfering non-nAbs: non-neutralizing/interfering Abs might interfere with the binding of nAbs by steric hindrance following a spatial occupancy of their epitope or a competition for the binding; otherwise the binding of non-neutralizing/interfering Abs may induce conformational changes on the viral protein, thus affecting nAb binding to the antigen. Non-neutralizing/interfering Abs are depicted in black while nAbs in yellow. The HCV genome encodes a single polyprotein of about 3,000 aminoacids that is processed by host and viral proteases into at least 3 structural (core, E1 and E2) and 7 non-structural ( p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B ) proteins [21, 22] . In particular, the envelope type I membrane glycoproteins E1 and E2 form non-covalent heterodimers on the surface of the HCV envelope and allow clathrin-mediated virus endocytosis interacting consecutively with several entry cellular factors such as glycosaminoglycans [23] [24] [25] , low-density lipoprotein receptor [26, 27] , scavenger receptor class B type I [28] , the tetraspanin CD81 [29] , the tight-junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin, and the recently described Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against this virus has been hindered mainly by its high mutation rate that gives rise to highly diversified viral variants, even within a single patient (quasispecies) [35] . Indeed, seven major genotypes, varying by up to 30% in nucleotide sequence, and several subtypes are recognized, each characterized by different clinical features such as different evolutionary rates to chronic liver diseases or different response to available antiviral therapies [21, 36, 37] . The development and use of anti-HCV mAbs capable of targeting structurally and functionally conserved regions of the highly variable viral particles are being considered as novel therapeutic tools [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In particular, the production of potent nAbs in acute infections has been shown to correlate with viral clearance in a single-source outbreak cohort [44] . Moreover, in vaccinated chimpanzees, a sustained Ab response to envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 correlates with reduced viremia [45] , while the passive administration of neutralizing mAbs in a uPA-SCID chimeric mouse model of infection was able to protect against challenge with a HCV quasispecies inoculum [46] . Broadly cross-neutralizing human mAbs directed against the surface E2 glycoprotein of HCV (HCV/E2) are typically directed against functionally important regions within the CD81 binding site [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] , as well as against other critical residues highly conserved among different genotypes [55, 56] . This aspect is crucial for the possible therapeutic in vivo use of such mAbs, but it may not be sufficient since it has been recently supposed that other non-nAb populations may interfere with their neutralizing activity [39, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . In fact, in persistently infected individuals anti-HCV/E2 cross-nAbs are generally elicited at low titer and in a late stage of the infection, leading to a poor control of viremia, whereas quasispecies-specific neutralizing or high titer non-nAbs are elicited earlier [53, [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Moreover, the in vivo use of anti-HCV polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations in both chimpanzees and humans has been disappointing, and clinical studies have shown that these preparations fail to prevent recurrent infections in patients after liver transplantation [63] . At this regard, a recent paper has suggested that the effect of some of these nAbs, directed against functionally important residues involved in the viral binding to CD81 (within epitope I, encompassing aminoacid residues 412-426), could be hindered by the presence of non-nAbs binding residues within epitope II on HCV/E2 (aminoacid residues 434-446) [58] . In particular, blocking of these interfering epitope II-specific Abs not only raised the neutralizing titer of serum containing both epitope I-and epitope II-specific Abs, but also uncovered a broader cross-genotype neutralizing response [58] . However, the role (and the existence itself) of these interfering Abs in influencing HCV infection is still controversial. Some authors recently corroborated the data of Zhang et al. by in vitro neutralization assays using serum-derived HCV of genotype 4a and polyclonal Abs derived from immunized goats with different conserved peptides spanning aminoacid residues 412-419, 430-447 and 517-531 of HCV/E2 glycoprotein [64] . In particular, this group found an interfering activity exerted by the weakly neutralizing 430-447-elicited Abs on the neutralizing activity of both the 412-419 and the 517-531-elicited Abs [64] . Interestingly, according to the putative model for E2 folding, all the three aforementioned regions would lie next to each other on the glycoprotein [48] . Therefore, this structural prediction possibly supports the interfering effect of epitope II-directed Abs. However, while this predicted structure is currently the best model available, these conclusions cannot be absolutely ascertained. For this purpose, the availability of E1-E2 crystal will certainly accelerate the fine elucidation of the spatial proximities of neutralizing and interfering mAbs on the E1-E2 structure and, consequently, structure-based vaccine progress. Moreover, it is noteworthy that individuals with Abs that target the region of E2 encompassing epitope I frequently harbor Abs that recognize the region containing epitope II, thus confirming the co-immunogenicity of these epitopes [58] . Finally, it has been shown both a low prevalence (less than 2.5%) and a low titer of epitope I-reactive Abs in sera from both chronic and acute resolved infections thus supporting the hypothesis of a conformational masking by adjacent regions such as that containing epitope II [65] . In fact, Zhang et al. originally put forward the idea that once epitope II is bound to an Ab, the site of epitope I becomes masked and can no longer be recognized by specific nAbs. Indeed, depletion of Abs to epitope II in plasma from a chronically infected HCV patient and vaccinated chimpanzees recovered an otherwise undetectable cross-genotype neutralizing activity [58] . Another possibility is that the initial binding of interfering Abs to the region containing epitope II may induce conformational changes on E2 that inhibit the binding by epitope I-directed Abs, as recently suggested by Lapierre et al. for other anti-HCV/E2 Abs [66] . Conversely, these conclusions were not supported in a recent study by Tarr et al. using murine (AP33) and rat (2/69a) mAbs, as well as human immunoglobulin fractions affinity-purified on linear peptides representing distinct HCV/E2 domains clustering within the regions 412-426 and 434-446 [67] . Although confirming the previously reported co-immunogenicity of these two regions, the authors failed to demonstrate any inhibition between these two groups of Abs. Considering their results, the authors indeed suggested that interference by non-nAbs, at least to the region encompassing residues 434-446, is not a possible mechanism for HCV persistence in chronically infected individuals, as it had been originally proposed by Zhang et al. In accordance with the findings of Tarr and colleagues, Keck et al. described anti-HCV/E2 human mAbs binding conformation-sensitive epitopes encompassing also some residues within the 434-446 interfering region [56] . These mAbs are broadly neutralizing and do not lead to viral escape mutants, demonstrating the functional importance of their epitopes. The authors conclude that not all Abs directed against epitope II are interfering, but they also speculate that the interfering activity could be limited to Abs recognizing linear epitopes within it [56] . Recently, we have partly confirmed the observations of Zhang et al. using a panel of anti-HCV/E2 mAbs: the well characterized mouse anti-HCV/E2 mAb AP33, whose epitope encompasses epitope I (aminoacid residues 412-423), and a weakly neutralizing human anti-HCV/E2 mAb (named e509), whose epitope encompasses epitope II [68] . In particular, we found that e509 is able to interfere with the neutralizing activity of AP33 on genotype 1a virus (strain H77). Instead, we found that e509 does not minimally interfere with the activity of two other broadly cross-neutralizing human anti-HCV/E2 mAbs, named e20 and e137 [49, 69] . Interestingly, we found that both e20 and e137 bind also residues within epitope II, at a higher affinity compared to e509, thus displacing it from the interfering epitope and, therefore, keeping unaltered their neutralizing activity. Thus, in our opinion, the described divergent observations reported above may depend on the different Ab specificities present in the polyclonal preparations used and, probably, also on the different HCV genotypes infecting the studied patients [68] . Moreover, the different strategies adopted in isolating epitope I-and epitope II-directed Abs followed in the studies above could explain the different data obtained. In fact, immunoglobulins purified on peptides representing distinct HCV/E2 regions [67] are obviously directed against linear epitopes; these preparations are certainly different from mAbs cloned using a full-length HCV/E2 glycoprotein, which are more probably directed against conformational epitopes including also residues outside the investigated linear regions [54] . To summarize, in the HCV field several works support the existence of interfering Ab populations and hypothesize their possible role in HCV persistence, as demonstrated using human plasma-derived immunoglobulin preparations, human mAbs, and sera of animals vaccinated with recombinant HCV/E2 peptides. The possible mechanism leading to the interference is still controversial, but both direct steric hindrance and induced antigen conformational changes have been hypothesized. On the other hand, other papers do not confirm these findings, suggesting that the putative interfering epitope II may be targeted by Abs endowed with a broadly neutralizing activity. Our recent paper, using well characterized mAbs [68] , shows that the interfering Abs do exist but that their overall effect may be biased by the presence of nAbs with different binding features and by the infecting HCV genotype. Future works investigating the in vivo role of these interfering Ab subpopulations in HCV persistence will certainly be very useful. The influenza viruses circulate worldwide in animal reservoirs, especially water fowl, potentially affecting humans of any age group. Influenza viruses are classified into types A, B or C based on antigenic differences of their nucleoprotein and matrix protein. The most clinically relevant and variable type is influenza A which is divided in several subtypes, according to the antigenic characteristic of the two envelope glycoproteins, and causes epidemic and pandemic infections [70] . The yearly recurring influenza epidemics are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among risk groups (such as elderly people or those with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and children) [71] ; the global spread of pandemic influenza viruses can cause millions of deaths [72] . Within the enveloped influenza virion eight segments of negative single-stranded RNA are protected by the nucleocapsid protein, forming the ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The first six RNA segments each code for a single protein: PB2, PB1, and PA (all constituting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), the hemagglutinin (HA), the nucleoprotein (NP), the neuraminidase (NA). The last two segments each code for two different proteins: the matrix proteins (M1 and M2) and the non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Three different proteins (HA, NA and M2) are present on the viral envelope. The HA glycoprotein is the most abundant and it is the major target of the humoral immune response. Together with the NA transmembrane glycoprotein, HA is capable of eliciting a subtype-specific immune responses which is fully protective within, but only partially protective across different subtypes [73] . HA is synthesized as inactive precursor that transits into its active form upon cleavage by host cell proteases, and which is present on the viral membrane as homotrimers. HA trimers bind to 2,6-linked sialic acid molecules on cell membrane proteins or lipids through domains located in the globular head of each monomer. Subsequently, the viral envelope fuses by clathrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms with the endocytic vesicle membrane through the HA fusion peptide located in the stem region of each monomer. As a consequence, viral components are released into the host cell and can subvert the synthetic capabilities of the host cell for production and release of progeny particles [74] .Question: What are the non-structural proteins encoded by the HCV genome?","answer":"p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

time feedback on the pattern of muscle activation during wbt .recently , a new class of video games called exergames ( exg ) has used virtual reality to  provide the user with perceptual and performance emulation , which has the potential for  sensory ability development3 and muscle  activation4 .various studies have used  interactive virtual games from the nintendo wii , the world s most popular exg , to assess  their implications in the rehabilitation process and neuromuscular training5 . considering the importance of understanding the muscle activation patterns during wbt and  the influencing factors , e.g. , real -

time feedback . during the execution  of these tasks , the subjects were positioned above the wii balance board located 1.0  m from  the sensor bar , which was attached at the base of a 42-inch television .each exercise was  performed twice in 3 randomized experimental conditions ( with visual feedback , with auditory  feedback , and with no feedback ) , with an interval of 5  min between the tasks .the 4-lead emg system , miotool 400 ( miotec , equipamentos biomdicos , porto alegre , rs ,  brazil ) coupled to a personal computer was used to record muscle activity . muscle activation  of the dominant limb s vastus medialis ( vm ) , vastus lateralis ( vl ) , and rectus femoris ( rf )  was recorded for each participant using bipolar surface disc electrodes ( ag -

promoting gaming  systems are considered an attractive exercise tool perhaps due to their relative  inexpensiveness , graphics that enable more enjoyable playing as well as potentially aid in  adherence to physical activity programs , and generation of real - time feedback to improve  task performance6 .thus , rehabilitation  using real - time feedback could alter the emg activation pattern of the quadriceps muscles ,  resulting in different joint movement patterns and promoting more efficient muscle  activation .this hypothesis , if confirmed , could favor the incorporation of wii games into  clinical programs .therefore , the purpose of the present study was to verify the influence  of real - time feedback on emg patterns of quadriceps muscles during wbt conducted using the  wii console , as well as the level of activation among the muscles ( vm , vl , and rf ) in each  exercise . to our knowledge , this is the first study that investigated these associations . our primary findings revealed that there are no differences among the emg patterns generated  in the visual feedback , auditory feedback , and no feedback conditions .however , considering  the potential of wii - games for entertainment , fun , and motivation , it is advantageous to  include these exercises in clinical programs to strengthen the quadriceps muscle but without  the additional benefit of feedback. also , we found that the muscle activity of the vm and vl  varied between 18.229.2% mvic and was higher ( 4762% ) than the variation in the rf , which  was between 7.313.0% mvic .noehren , scholz , and davis7 studied a  group of runners with patellofemoral pain syndrome and determined that gait retraining using  real - time feedback ( visual feedback during 4 sessions for 1 week ) was effective in reducing  pain and improving hip mechanics during single - leg squats .white and lifeso8 demonstrated that after 8 weeks of gait  retraining using real - time feedback from an instrumented treadmill , the subjects were able  to significantly improve their loading symmetry .these results suggest that motor patterns  may be altered after at least 1 week of exposure to the feedback stimulus .thus , we believed  that the short - term generation of both visual and auditory feedback was insufficient to  promote learning of new and more efficient motor patterns and , consequently , alter emg  activity . in the present study ,the wbt were selected based on their wide application related to  practicality , functionality , and efficiency in promoting strengthening of lower limb  muscles .dynamic squatting exercises have been studied as important tools for rehabilitation  programs , primarily those utilizing knee emg9 . according to our results ,the 2 vasti muscles produce approximately  50% more activity than the rf during wbt .the lower emg activity of the rf during the wbt  studied compared with that of the vm and vl muscles may be due to the biarticular function  of the rf as both a hip flexor and knee extensor .clinically , it is important to note that  increased activity in the rf would increase hip flexor torque , with a concomitant increase  in the activation of the antagonist muscles ( e.g. , hamstrings and gluteus  maximus ) to extend the hip , thereby altering the biomechanics of the tasks10 .another aspect that deserves mention is  the similarity between the emg activation patterns of the vasti muscles . considering that  healthy adults with normal knees show vm / vl ratios of close to 19 , the study subjects had adequate emg behavior for these  muscles ( healthy subjects ) .these findings could also justify the insufficiency of real - time  feedback to promote additional improvements in emg activation patterns of the quadriceps . in  addition , selective strengthening of the vm is necessary to prevent and improve knee joint  dysfunction11 . in this case , the lunge ,  sle , and slr exercises did not show any selectivity , at least in the experimental conditions  studied .there is a need for a better understanding of the emg activation pattern strategies that  occur in exg and their implementation . in the only study found that was conducted for this  purpose , park , lee , and lee4 showed that  exg was an effective intervention for the muscle activities of the tibialis anterior and  gastrocnemius of normal adults . for future research, we suggest investigation involving  subjects with motor impairment , which could highlight a possible feedback effect , other wii  exercises with a greater degree of difficulty , and a longer duration of feedback exposure  ( e.g. , during a training protocol ) .","answer":"[ purpose ] this investigation evaluated the effect of real -

In this multicentre, open-label, randomised trial, 1216 antiretroviral-therapy-naive patients were assigned nevirapine 400 mg once daily, nevirapine 200 mg twice daily, efavirenz 600 mg once daily, or nevirapine (400 mg) and efavirenz (800 mg) once daily, plus stavudine and lamivudine, for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment failure (less than 1 log(10) decline in plasma HIV-1 RNA in the first 12 weeks or two consecutive measurements of more than 50 copies per mL from week 24 onwards, disease progression [new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grade C event or death], or change of allocated treatment). Analyses were by intention to treat.                Treatment failure occurred in 96 (43.6%) of 220 patients assigned nevirapine once daily, 169 (43.7%) of 387 assigned nevirapine twice daily, 151 (37.8%) of 400 assigned efavirenz, and 111 (53.1%) of 209 assigned nevirapine plus efavirenz. The difference between nevirapine twice daily and efavirenz was 5.9% (95% CI -0.9 to 12.8). There were no significant differences among the study groups in the proportions with plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations below 50 copies per mL at week 48 (p=0.193) or the increases in CD4-positive cells (p=0.800). Nevirapine plus efavirenz was associated with the highest frequency of clinical adverse events, and nevirapine once daily with significantly more hepatobiliary laboratory toxicities than efavirenz. Of 25 observed deaths, two were attributed to nevirapine.                Antiretroviral therapy with nevirapine or efavirenz showed similar efficacy, so triple-drug regimens with either NNRTI are valid for first-line treatment. There are, however, differences in safety profiles. Combination of nevirapine and efavirenz did not improve efficacy but caused more adverse events.Title 2:Randomized, open-label, comparative trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three antiretroviral drug combinations including two nucleoside analogues and nevirapine for previously untreated HIV-1 Infection: the OzCombo 2 study.Abstract 2:To assess and compare the efficacy and safety of three triple combination antiretroviral therapies in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients.                Seventy treatment-naive HIV-infected adults with CD4+ T-cell counts >50/microL were randomized to receive either zidovudine + lamivudine + nevirapine (AZT + 3TC + NVP), stavudine + didanosine + nevirapine (d4T+ddI+NVP), or stavudine + lamivudine + nevirapine (d4T+3TC+NVP) for 52 weeks. Patient assessments were conducted monthly and included measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts and evaluations for drug toxicity.                The mean time-weighted reductions in plasma HIV RNA in the AZT+3TC+NVP, d4T+3TC+NVP, and d4T+ddI+NVP groups were 1.29, 2.13, and 1.78 log(10) copies/mL, respectively (p =.389). The proportions of patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL in the AZT+3TC+NVP, d4T+3TC+NVP, and d4T+ddI+NVP groups were 73%, 68%, and 80%, respectively (p =.71). The mean time-weighted increases in CD4+ T-cell counts in the AZT+3TC+NVP, d4T+3TC+NVP, and d4T+ddI+NVP groups were 139, 113, and 174 cells/microL, respectively (p =.30). Three patients ceased assigned treatment due to rash (one from each treatment arm), and 5 of the 45 patients on d4T (3 from the d4T+3TC+NVP arm and 2 from the d4T+ddI+NVP arm) ceased assigned treatment due to neuropathy.                All three-drug combinations were equally effective at suppressing viral load and increasing CD4+ T-cell counts. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in virological or immunological response or cessation of study drugs due to adverse events, although it is possible that the study was underpowered to detect differences. NVP was safe and efficacious in this setting, and efficacy was not influenced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone.","answer":"The combination of nevirapine, 3TC and d4T is as efficacious as a combination of efavirenz, 3TC and d4T. Once-daily NVP with twice-daily 3TC and d4T is as efficacious as twice-daily NVP, 3TC and d4T. However, toxicity may be increased in the once-daily NVP regime. Additional trials of sufficient duration are required to provide better evidence for the use of this combination as a first line therapy. Ideally, trials should use standardised assessment measures especially with respect to measuring viral load, so that results can be compared and combined in meta-analyses."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

What are the types of approaches emerging over time? 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Energy use is becoming a key design consideration in computing infrastructures and services. In this paper we focus on service-based applications and we propose an adaptation framework that can be used to reduce power consumption according to the observed workload. The adaptation guarantees a trade-off between energy consumption and system performance. The approach is based on the principle of proportional energy consumption obtained by scaling down energy for unused resources, considering both the number of servers switched on and their operating frequencies. Stochastic Petri nets are proposed for the modeling of the framework concerns, their analyses give results about the trade-offs. The application of the approach to a simple case study shows its usefulness and practical applicability. Finally, different types of workloads are analyzed with validation purposes. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  This paper proposes a methodology for energy aware management of virtualized data centers (DC) based on dynamically adapting and scaling the computing capacity to the characteristics of the workload. To assess the energy efficiency of DC operation, we have defined a novel ontological model for representing its energy and performance characteristics and a new metric for aggregating Green and Key Performance Indicators and calculating at run-time the DC Greenness Level. Workload balancing and consolidation is achieved by means of an automated reinforcement learning-based decision process targeting to increase the workload density and to scale down the unused computing resources. Evaluation results show that up to 15.6 % energy savings are obtained on our test bed DC. Tests conducted in a simulated environment show that the time and space overhead of our methodology are within reasonable limits and that by organizing the servers in hierarchical clusters, the methodology can manage highly dynamic workload in large DCs with thousands of servers. The methodology is already implemented in the Green Cloud Scheduler, an official component of the OpenNebula Middleware which is available in the OpenNebula Ecosystem web site to be downloaded and used.Literature Review:","answer":"As mentioned before, we have identified two types of approaches, namely software design approaches (SDA) and system engineering approaches (SEA). Some primary studies propose solutions that realize both types of approaches (SEA+SDA). Figure 2 shows the distribution of each type of approaches in the list of our primary studies over the years. As shown in the figure, there is a growing trend for the both SEA and SDA approach types until 2014, when we witness a peak in adoption of the SEA and SDA types. The second peak is in 2017, in which all the types of approaches have been investigated. Mostly, the approach type SEA is adopted more than other types in each year. We see that only in 2012 and 2015, the primary studies turn their attention more towards the type SDA. This means that a lot of effort has been devoted to system engineering approaches in order to realize runtime adaptation. Many scheduling algorithms and infrastructure configuration mechanisms are implemented at this stage. We expect to see an increase in growth for all types of approaches in the coming years. An example for type SEA is introduced in BIB001 . They provide a self-adaptive framework that adjusts cluster configurations during runtime, to cover heterogeneity and cluster status variations. The framework has built-in learning algorithms to compare current and previous configurations, and predict cluster performance. All the MAPE functionalities are realized with including essential components such as a monitoring network, a dynamic predictive model, and a runtime scheduler. Differently, Perez-Palacin et al. BIB002 present an approach of type SDA. They introduce a reference architecture, or an adaptation framework, based on a three-layer software architecture for selfmanaged systems. The reference architecture uses model-driven techniques to transform design patterns into different Stochastic Petri Nets subnets. We have identified a few studies of type SEA+SDA. For instance, Cioara et al. BIB003 propose a methodology for energy-aware management in data centers. They have defined an ontological model for representing the key indicators in data centers, namely energy and performance. The model helps calculate the level of energy efficiency in data centers at runtime and apply reconfigurations when needed."},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

We provide a justification of our claim based on the Predictive, Descriptive, and Relevant (PDR) framework proposed by Murdoch et al. (2019). Specifically, by injecting human-interpretable patterns into the model, we increase the model’s descriptive accuracy by explicitly encoding useful relationships between input tokens in the attention weights while simultaneously improving the predictive accuracy in task performance. Further, the patterns are relevant for the problem since they are discovered in the human-in-the-loop process and are verified to be important for the task. As shown in Table 1, our pattern-infused models outperform the plain transformer models for both the CNN/DM and NYT-50 datasets under all three settings(6 Layer 8 Heads, 6 Layer 12 Heads, and 6 Layer 12 Heads with BERT embeddings).Similarly for topic segmentation,results also show that the pattern-injection approach substantially outperforms the vanilla transformer across all metrics.It is worthemphasizing that the performance gain is slightly higher for summarization models. When normalized by the ROUGE scores of extractive oracle summaries555As reported by Liu and Lapata (2019), the ROUGE scores (R-1/R-2/R-L) of the oracle upper bound for CNN/DM and NYT-50 are respectively, 52.59/31.24/48.87 and 49.18/33.24/46.02., the pattern-infused summarization models achieve an average 15% improvement over the baselines, while the topic-segmentation models achieve a 12% improvement over the baselines.In-line with prior work (McCoy et al., 2020), we also find that the performance is consistent across random seeds, where we report an extremely low standard deviation of0.03 (ROUGE) and 0.002 (F1) for extractive summarization and topic segmentation, respectively. Overall, the results from our experiments convincingly demonstrates the benefits of our approach and the generalizability of the patterns discovered by our pipeline. In summary, the key aim of our experiments was to verify consistent improvements over our own baselines under the same settings in order to probethe benefits (effectiveness and efficiency) of the discovered patterns for the task. Therefore, we do not perform extensive tuning to achieve the same results reported by Liu and Lapata (2019).Question: How was performance measured and was the performance of the human-guided knowledge distilled model significantly higher?","answer":"Interpretability is measured with the PDR framework.

identification of the dead .the forensic importance of dental tissue has been well recognized because tooth is the hardest of all human tissues .they are well preserved for a long period even after death , hence dental remains are the most stable biological evidence encountered in crime cases and yield useful information .blood grouping has been one of the major factors for identification of biological materials in forensic investigations and is a widely used technique in forensic laboratories .the presence of abo blood group and rhesus factor is applied to inherited antigens detected on red cell surface by specific antibodies .once the blood group and rhesus factor are established , it remains unchanged throughout life .kind in 1960 discovered the presence of abo blood group in saliva by absorption - elution ( ae ) method .blood grouping from dried stain by elution procedure was described more than 50 years ago but not employed widely in forensic serology , until 1960 , when kind refined this technique .ae technique / procedure originally devised by siracusa is now employed in all forensic laboratories because it is proven to be most sensitive , reliable and reproducible .pulp tissue is one of the most protected tissues being surrounded from all sides by dental hard tissues .pulp contains numerous blood vessels and blood group antigens are certainly present in tooth pulp .the distribution of abo substances from the pulp cavity wall to the dentin edge and the enamel gradually reduces , because of fewer possibilities of diffusion of antigens from both blood and saliva .the existence of blood group antigens in tooth dentin and enamel and their nature has been substantiated by infusion  sedimentation phenomena combined with inherently present antigens .this theory describes the infusion of water - soluble antigens from saliva into the tooth tissue .the presence of abo blood group and rhesus factor antigen in soft and hard dental tissues makes a possible contribution in human identification even in decomposed bodies .therefore , blood group and rhesus factor determination for biological evidence on tooth material is of great importance in forensic odontology .the aim of this study was to determine the abo blood grouping and rhesus factor from dentin and pulp of extracted teeth using  ae technique  at 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months after extraction .a brief case history with relevant medical history was recorded from patients selected for study and consent was taken .the blood groups were determined for all the study participants using capillary blood by slide agglutination method .carious teeth and grossly decayed teeth were excluded ; and teeth extracted for periodontal , and orthodontic purposes were included in the study .the extraction procedure was carried out under local anesthesia following the aseptic protocol in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery .the extracted teeth were dried and stored in labeled bottles for a

) dried pulp tissue a drop of 0.5% red cell suspension of known blood group a , b and o was freshly prepared and immediately put into respective test tubes .the samples were incubated at 37c for 30 min to enhance agglutination , and then , it was centrifuged at 15002000 rpm for 1 min . by gentleshaking of the test tube , the presence or absence of red cell agglutination was ascertained macroscopically and microscopically at a magnification of 4 [ figures 2 and 3 ] .macroscopic observation of the agglutination in dentin ( l ) and pulp ( r ) samples microscopic observation of the

.abo blood grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased . in dentine ,the sensitivity ranged from 100% to 73% and pulp sensitivity ranged from 100% to 80% .there was no significant difference in the sensitivities of dentin and pulp [ table 1 ] .abo blood grouping for pulp and dentine rh factor grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased up to 9 months .in dentine , the sensitivity ranged from 100% to 40% and pulp sensitivity ranged from 100% to 23% .overall pulp showed better sensitivity than dentin except at 12 months time period where dentin showed better sensitivity than pulp .moreover , in comparison with the sensitivities of dentin and pulp , the p values obtained were not significant [ table 2 ] .rh factor blood grouping for pulp and dentine when compared the sensitivity of abo and rh factor blood grouping of dentin and pulp in accordance to time period dentin and pulp showed almost similar results from 0 to 9 months . at 12 monthsboth dentin and pulp showed vast difference in the sensitivities of abo and rh blood grouping with significant p value [ table 3 ] .comparison of abo and rh factor blood grouping for dentin and pulp the overall mean sensitivity of dentin for abo blood grouping is 88% and for rh factor , blood grouping is 79% , with a significant p = 0.03 .the overall mean sensitivity of pulp for abo blood grouping is 90% and for rh factor , blood grouping is 82% with a significant p = 0.04 .dentin and pulp showed the p = 0.58 for abo blood grouping and 0.46 for rh factor blood grouping [ table 4 and figure 4 ] .overall comparison of blood group systems and teeth components graph of comparisons of the overall sensitivity of abo and rh factor blood grouping of dentin and pulplattes have rightly said  the fact that belonging to a definite blood group is a fixed character of every human being and can be altered neither by lapse of time nor by intercurrent disease . human identification is the mainstay of civilization , and the identification of unknown individuals has always been of paramount importance to society .the use of blood group substances in medico - legal examination is grounded on the fact that once a blood group is established in an individual , it remains unchanged for a lifetime . for several decades ,the technique ae is the most sensitive and the most widely employed . according to kind ,nickolls and periera and outtridge , ae has proved to be markedly more sensitive than the absorption - inhibition test . ae has shown more success rate than mixed - agglutination for certain antigens .rh blood group is considered to be the most complex genetically of all the blood type systems since it involves 45 different antigens on the surface of red cell .teeth are used for blood grouping and are considered as a hallmark for identification of biological materials in forensic investigations .considering this fact in our present study , an attempt was made to detect abo and rh factor antigen from dentin and pulp over a time period of 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months .for abo blood grouping , both dentin and pulp showed 100% sensitivity with the samples tested immediately after extraction and the sensitivity gradually reduced as time period prolonged .pulp showed better sensitivity than dentin but the difference was statistically insignificant , suggesting both dentin and pulp have almost equal antigenic potential although pulp is better , the sensitivity weakened as the time period increased . till date , the various studies conducted by smeets et al . , shetty and premlata , ballal and david and ramnarayan et al . at different time period showed pulp to be better tool than dentin and there was a decrease in the sensitivity of the dentin and pulp as the time periods increased .the overall decrease in the sensitivity could be due to dehydration , the loss of pulp antigens , insufficient quantity of pulp , calcification of the canals , cell lysis ; contamination of the tooth or time lapse for the procedure . for rh factor blood grouping , both dentin and pulp showed 100% sensitivity when the samples were tested immediately after extraction and the sensitivity gradually reduced as time period prolonged .pulp showed better results than dentine , but the difference was statistically insignificant , suggesting both dentin and pulp have almost equal antigenic potential which weakened as the time period increased , similar to abo antigens .this may be attributed to autolysis , dehydration and the loss of pulp antigens similar to abo antigens .is the only study available in english language literature that was conducted for determination of rh factor antigens along with abo blood group antigens in freshly obtained pulp samples . in our study ,both pulp and dentin samples were used and tested at 0 month to an extensive time period of 12 months .abo and rh factor blood grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased . at 12 months ,both dentin and pulp showed a drastic decrease in the sensitivity for rh factor blood grouping than the abo blood grouping with a statistically significant difference .the sensitivity of pulp was better than dentin in both the blood grouping systems with an insignificant p value .abo blood grouping was better than rh factor grouping in both the teeth components and the p values obtained were significant .this indicates that the antigenicity of pulp is better than dentin in both abo and rh blood groups , and abo antigens were better expressed than rh factor blood group antigens .the outcome of our study showed that abo and rh blood group antigens could be detected up to 12 months , and there are no studies in the english literature to compare this study .this shows that pulp contains more amounts of antigen than the dentin and its antigenicity decreases with time .blood grouping on teeth is not a straight forward technique ; the concentrations of blood group antigens are low in the teeth when compared to other tissues and body fluids . in this study ,it is assumed that the origin of blood group antigen in dental hard tissue is based on the infusion sedimentation phenomenon combined with inherently present antigens .considering all the factors that support the presence of blood group antigens in dentin and pulp and also the pitfalls of false positive result or mistyping of blood group , over a period in this study , we came to a close consequence that the results obtained with pulp were better than that of dentine .another aspect to be highlighted here is abo and rh factor antigens were detected from both dentin and pulp even up to 12 months after extraction of the teeth .blood grouping has been one of the bases for identification of biological materials in forensic investigations and abo blood grouping is a widely used technique in forensic laboratories .the presence of abo blood group antigens along with rh factor antigens in pulp and hard dental tissues makes it a potential substance in the identification of highly decomposed bodies or body part where teeth and bones are the only significant tissue remains .blood group substances in the hard dental tissues thus remain unaffected even in adverse environmental conditions .teeth were used as a mode of identification of blood group in this study because teeth are one of the most indestructible parts of the body and exhibit the least turnover of natural structure .the presence of abo blood group and rh factor antigen in soft and hard tissue makes it possible for identification of the deceased .ae test to identify blood groups in teeth may be of immense value not only in the identification of accused but also in the investigation of mass disaster and fire victims . on the basis of results obtained in our study , both dentin and pulp are reliable sources of blood group determination for upto 12 months for abo and rh factor blood grouping , especially where teeth ensues to be the only remnants existing for individual identity .although expression of abo blood groups and rh factor was seen in both dentin and pulp , intensity of abo blood groups and rh factor was higher in pulp than dentin and abo blood group antigens were better expressed than rh factor antigens in both dentin and pulp .blood group determination from teeth warrants advance exploration as the establishment of identification of a person from the skeletal remains is of paramount importance to a forensic odontologist . till date , in english language literature no studies have been conducted to detect abo and rh factor blood group antigens from tooth material for up to 12 months .this study detected blood groups antigens of abo and rh systems from tooth material over this extensive time period of 12 months .this study is thus a quantum of what has been known and learned and how much more needs to be understood in this challenging branch of forensic odontology .","answer":"objective : the aim of the study was to determine blood groups and rhesus

Resting-state functional MRI revealed that the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus was functionally disconnected from other brain regions within the default-mode network.Our case report suggests that assessment of the functional connectivity in the resting-state default-mode network could be a useful marker of consciousness disturbance even in the presence of a reversible brain lesion.A present and intact DMN was observed in controls and those patients who subsequently regained consciousness, but was disrupted in all patients who failed to regain consciousness.The results suggest that the DMN is necessary but not sufficient to support consciousness.Clinically, DMN connectivity may serve as an indicator of the extent of cortical disruption and predict reversible impairments in consciousness.Recent studies on resting state activity in DOC, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, show that functional connectivity is disrupted in the task-negative or the default mode network.This report shows for the first time, in three patients, that the persistent vegetative state (PVS) is marked by a dysfunctional default mode network, with decreased connectivity in several brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated cortex, especially in the right hemisphere.","answer":"Functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) is reduced in patients with different disorders of consciousness, and correlates with the level of consciousness. Specifically, functional connectivity in the default mode network was shown to be absent in brain death patients, extremely low in vegetative state patients and slightly decreased in minimally conscious state patients when compared to healthy subjects. Therefore, functional connectivity in the default mode network was suggested to be valuable in differentiating patients with different disorders of consciousness. Clinically, functional connectivity in the default mode network was also shown to be an indicator of the extent of cortical disruption and predict reversible impairments in consciousness."},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

However, the use of mm-wave technologies in cellular networks is not straightforward due to mm-wave harsh propagation conditions that limit access availability. In order to overcome this obstacle, hybrid network architectures are being considered where mm-wave small cells can exploit an overlay coverage layer based on legacy technology. The additional mm-wave layer can also take advantage of a functional split between control and user plane, that allows to delegate most of the signaling functions to legacy base stations and to gather context information from users for resource optimization. However, mm-wave technology requires high gain antenna systems to compensate for high path loss and limited power, e.g., through the use of multiple antennas for high directivity. Directional transmissions must be also used for the cell discovery and synchronization process, and this can lead to a non-negligible delay due to the need to scan the cell area with multiple transmissions at different directions. In this paper, we propose to exploit the context information related to user position, provided by the separated control plane, to improve the cell discovery procedure and minimize delay. We investigate the fundamental trade-offs of the cell discovery process with directional antennas and the effects of the context information accuracy on its performance. Numerical results are provided to validate our observations.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The acute disparity between increasing bandwidth demand and available spectrum has brought millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to the forefront of candidate solutions for the next-generation cellular networks. Highly directional transmissions are essential for cellular communication in these frequencies to compensate for higher isotropic path loss. This reliance on directional beamforming, however, complicates initial cell search since mobiles and base stations must jointly search over a potentially large angular directional space to locate a suitable path to initiate communication. To address this problem, this paper proposes a directional cell discovery procedure where base stations periodically transmit synchronization signals, potentially in time-varying random directions, to scan the angular space. Detectors for these signals are derived based on a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) under various signal and receiver assumptions. The detectors are then simulated under realistic design parameters and channels based on actual experimental measurements at 28 GHz in New York City. The study reveals two key findings: 1) digital beamforming can significantly outperform analog beamforming even when digital beamforming uses very low quantization to compensate for the additional power requirements and 2) omnidirectional transmissions of the synchronization signals from the base station generally outperform random directional scanning.[2]: Communication in millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum has gained an increasing interests for tackling the spectrum crunch problem and meeting the high network capacity demand in 4G and beyond. Considering the channel characteristics of mmWave bands, it can be fit into heterogeneous networks (HetNet) for boosting local-area data rate. In this paper, we investigate the challenges in deploying an anchor-booster based HetNet with mmWave capable booster cells. We show that due to the channel characteristics of mmWave bands, there could be a mismatch between the discoverable coverage area of booster cell at mmWave band and the actual supportable coverage area. Numerical results are provided in validating the observation. We suggest possible ways in addressing the coverage mismatch problem. This work provides insights on the deployment and implementation challenges in mmWave capable HetNets.","answer":"The cell discovery problem in mm-wave cellular networks has been considered in [1] and [2] .

To clarify the effects of cylcin E1 expression on HCC tumor progression, we studied the expression of cyclin E1 and inhibitory efficacy of regorafenib and sorafenib in HCC cells, and investigated a potential therapy that combines regorafenib treatment with cyclin E1 inhibition.  methods Western blotting for caspase-3 and Hoechst 33225 staining was used to measure the expression level of apoptosis-related proteins under drug treatment.  results Our results showed that enhanced expression of cyclin E1 after transfection compromised apoptosis in HCC cells induced by regorafenib or sorafenib. Conversely , down-regulation of cyclin E1 gene expression or inhibition of cyclin E1 by the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors dinaciclib ( DIN ) or flavopiridol sensitized HCC cells to regorafenib and sorafenib by inducing apoptosis . The expression of Mcl-1, which is modulated by STAT3, plays a key role in regulating the therapeutic effects of CDK inhibitors. Xenograft experiments conducted to test the efficacy of regorafenib combined with DIN showed dramatic tumor inhibitory effects due to induction of apoptosis. Our results suggested that the level of cyclin E1 expression in HCCs may be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to assess the antitumor effects of regorafenib or sorafenib.  conclusions Combining regorafenib and CDK inhibitors may enhance the clinical efficiency of the treatment of HCCs.sentence: Conversely , down-regulation of cyclin E1 gene expression or inhibition of cyclin E1 by the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors dinaciclib ( DIN ) or flavopiridol sensitized HCC cells to regorafenib and sorafenib by inducing apoptosis .","answer":"[[\\"flavopiridol\\", \\"regorafenib\\", \\"POS\\"], [\\"dinaciclib\\", \\"regorafenib\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Studies on transgenic flies have provided evidence that photosensitive Cryptochromes (Cry) are involved in the response to magnetic fields (MFs).Cryptochromes, blue-light absorbing proteins involved in the circadian clock, have been proposed to be the receptor molecules of the avian magnetic compass.Although it has been known for almost half a century that migratory birds can detect the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, the primary sensory mechanism behind this remarkable feat is still unclear. The leading hypothesis centers on radical pairs-magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates formed by photoexcitation of cryptochrome proteins in the retina.Biogenic magnetic particles have been detected in some migratory insects, which implies the basis of magnetoreception mechanism for orientation and navigation.Magnetoreception is essential for magnetic orientation in animal migration. The molecular basis for magnetoreception has recently been elucidated in fruitfly as complexes between the magnetic receptor magnetoreceptor (MagR) and its ligand cryptochrome (Cry). MagR and Cry are present in the animal kingdom.Magnetoreception is an enigmatic, poorly understood sensory ability, described mainly on the basis of behavioural studies in animals of diverse taxa.The photoreceptor protein cryptochrome is thought to host, upon light absorption, a radical pair that is sensitive to very weak magnetic fields, endowing migratory birds with a magnetic compass sense.","answer":"Magnetoreception is an enigmatic, poorly understood sensory ability, described mainly on the basis of behavioural studies in animals of diverse taxa.

Rural clients reported significantly more limitations than urban clients on several measures of physical functioning. The results also suggest that utilization of services was higher for those with more medical problems and those who lived in high distress areas, although these findings did not meet the criterion for statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS:Conclusions based on statistical evidence that geographic location and socioeconomic factors relate to significantly different health care service experience bear important implications for medical and health care support systems, especially on the community level.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"sickle cell\\", \\"sickle cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

In this paper, we focus on sparse digraphs and propose SDG, an algorithm that aims at generating graphs similar to real ones. Since real graphs are evolving and this evolution is important to study in order to understand the underlying dynamical system, we tackle the problem of generating series of graphs. We propose SEDGE, an algorithm meant to generate series of graphs similar to a real series. SEDGE is an extension of SDG. We consider graphs that are representations of software programs and show experimentally that our approach outperforms other existing approaches. Experiments show the performance of both algorithms.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.","answer":"We have shown that the in-degree and the out-degree distributions of the graphs generated by exhibit a power law.

Indeed, our graph is not growing, keeping a set of @math nodes, connecting them along the iterations of the algorithm. However, the departure from a power law is expected when the number of iterations is approximately @math , that is when the graph gets dense. However, as we emphasized it earlier, we only consider sparse graphs, and the number of iterations, hence the number of edges, remains @math , hence much less than @math ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

It is often more important for imaging agents to identify local and distant spread of disease than it is to identify a specific receptor presence. Two natural hormone peptide receptors, GRPR and Y1, are specifically interesting because expression of GRPR, Y1 or both is up-regulated in most breast cancers. We describe here the design and development of a new heterobivalent peptide ligand, truncated bombesin (t-BBN)/BVD15-DO3A, for dual-targeting of GRPR and Y1, and validation of its dual binding capability. Such a probe should be useful in imaging cells, tissues and tumors that are GRPR and/or Y1 positive and should target radioisotopes, for example, (68)Ga and/or (177)Lu, to more tumors cells than single GRPR or Y1 targeted probes. A GRP targeting ligand, J-G-Abz4-QWAVGHLM-NH(2) (J-G-Abz4-t-BBN), and an Y1 targeting ligand, INP-K[ε-J-(α-DO3A-ε-DGa)-K]-YRLRY-NH(2)([ε-J-(α-DO3A-ε-DGa)-K]-BVD-15), were synthesized and coupled to produce the heterobivalent ligand, t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A. Competitive displacement binding assays using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against (125)I-Tyr(4)-BBN yielded an IC(50) value of 18 ± 0.7 nM for GRPR in T-47D cells, a human breast cancer cell line. A similar assay using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against porcine (125)I-NPY showed IC(50) values of 80 ± 11 nM for Y1 receptor in MCF7 cells, another human breast cancer cell line. In conclusion, it is possible to construct a single DO3A chelate containing probe that can target both GRPR and Y1 on human tumor cells.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"bombesin\\", \\"(125)I\\", \\"Tyr\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"GRP\\", \\"(125)I-Tyr(4)-BBN\\", \\"GRPR\\", \\"Y1 receptors\\", \\"Y1\\", \\"t-BBN\\", \\"porcine (125)I-NPY\\", \\"Y1 receptor\\", \\"truncated bombesin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The method in [18] solves a series of penalized optimization problems to find the minimal perturbation, whereas [4] estimates the minimal perturbation by taking the sign of the gradientdisplaystylehat{bm{r}}(bm{x})=epsilon,text{sign}left(nabla_{bm{x}}J(bm{theta},bm{x},y)right),with J the cost used to train the neural network, bm{theta} is the model parameters, and y is the label of bm{x}. The method is called fast gradient sign method. In practice, in the absence of general rules to choose the parameter epsilon, we chose the smallest epsilon such that 90% of the data are misclassified after perturbation.555Using this method, we observed empirically that one cannot reach 100% misclassification rate on some datasets. In fact, even by increasing epsilon to be very large, this method can fail in misclassifying all samples. It can be seen that DeepFool estimates smaller perturbations (hence closer to minimal perturbation defined in (1)) than the ones computed using the competitive approaches. For example, the average perturbation obtained using DeepFool is 5 times lower than the one estimated with [4]. On the ILSVRC2012 challenge dataset, the average perturbation is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the fast gradient method. It should be noted moreover that the proposed approach also yields slightly smaller perturbation vectors than the method in [18]. The proposed approach is hence more accurate in detecting directions that can potentially fool neural networks. As a result, DeepFool can be used as a valuable tool to accurately assess the robustness of classifiers.On the complexity aspect, the proposed approach is substantially faster than the standard method proposed in [18].In fact, while the approach [18] involves a costly minimization of a series of objective functions, we observed empirically that DeepFool converges in a few iterations (i.e., less than 3) to a perturbation vector that fools the classifier. Hence, the proposed approach reaches a more accurate perturbation vector compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being computationally efficient. This makes it readily suitable to be used as a baseline method to estimate the robustness of very deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. In that context, we provide the first quantitative evaluation of the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. It can be seen that despite their very good test accuracy, these methods are extremely unstable to adversarial perturbations: a perturbation that is 1000 smaller in magnitude than the original image is sufficient to fool state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We illustrate in Figure 1 perturbed images generated by the fast gradient sign and DeepFool. It can be observed that the proposed method generates adversarial perturbations which are hardly perceptible, while the fast gradient sign method outputs a perturbation image with higher norm. In this section, we fine-tune the networks of Table 1 on adversarial examples to build more robust classifiers for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Specifically, for each network, we performed two experiments: (i) Fine-tuning the network on DeepFool’s adversarial examples, (ii) Fine-tuning the network on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples.We fine-tune the networks by performing 5 additional epochs, with a 50% decreased learning rate only on the perturbed training set. For each experiment, the same training data was used through all 5 extra epochs. For the sake of completeness, we also performed 5 extra epochs on the original data. The evolution of hat{rho}_{text{adv}} for the different fine-tuning strategies is shown in Figures 5(a) to 5(d), where the robustness hat{rho}_{text{adv}} is estimated using DeepFool, since this is the most accurate method, as shown in Table 1. Observe that fine-tuning with DeepFool adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness of the networks to adversarial perturbations even after one extra epoch. For example, the robustness of the networks on MNIST is improved by 50% and NIN’s robustness is increased by about 40%. On the other hand, quite surprisingly, the method in [4] can lead to a decreased robustness to adversarial perturbations of the network. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the fact that perturbations estimated using the fast gradient sign method are much larger than minimal adversarial perturbations. Fine-tuning the network with overly perturbed images decreases the robustness of the networks to adversarial perturbations.To verify this hypothesis, we compare in Figure 7 the adversarial robustness of a network that is fine-tuned with the adversarial examples obtained using DeepFool, where norms of perturbations have been deliberately multiplied by alpha=1,2,3. Interestingly, we see that by magnifying the norms of the adversarial perturbations, the robustness of the fine-tuned network is decreased. This might explain why overly perturbed images decrease the robustness of MNIST networks: these perturbations can really change the class of the digits, hence fine-tuning based on these examples can lead to a drop of the robustness (for an illustration, see Figure 8). This lends credence to our hypothesis, and further shows the importance of designing accurate methods to compute minimal perturbations. Table 3 lists the accuracies of the fine-tuned networks. It can be seen that fine-tuning with DeepFool can improve the accuracy of the networks. Conversely, fine-tuning with the approach in [4] has led to a decrease of the test accuracy in all our experiments. This confirms the explanation that the fast gradient sign method outputs overly perturbed images that lead to images that are unlikely to occur in the test data. Hence, it decreases the performance of the method as it acts as a regularizer that does not represent the distribution of the original data. This effect is analogous to geometric data augmentation schemes, where large transformations of the original samples have a counter-productive effect on generalization.666While the authors of [4] reported an increased generalization performance on the MNIST task (from 0.94% to 0.84%) using adversarial regularization, it should be noted that the their experimental setup is significantly different as [4] trained the network based on a modified cost function, while we performed straightforward fine-tuning. To emphasize the importance of a correct estimation of the minimal perturbation, we now show that using approximate methods can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the adversarial robustness of networks. We fine-tune the NIN classifier on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples. We follow the procedure described earlier but this time, we decreased the learning rate by 90%. We have evaluated the adversarial robustness of this network at different extra epochs using DeepFool and the fast gradient sign method. As one can see in Figure 9, the red plot exaggerates the effect of training on the adversarial examples. Moreover, it is not sensitive enough to demonstrate the loss of robustness at the first extra epoch. These observations confirm that using an accurate tool to measure the robustness of classifiers is crucial to derive conclusions about the robustness of networks.  Our main contributions are the following:•We propose a simple yet accurate method for computing and comparing the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations.•We perform an extensive experimental comparison, and show that 1) our method computes adversarial perturbations more reliably and efficiently than existing methods 2) augmenting training data with adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness to adversarial perturbations.•We show that using imprecise approaches for the computation of adversarial perturbations could lead to different and sometimes misleading conclusions about the robustness. Hence, our method provides a better understanding of this intriguing phenomenon and of its influence factors.We now review some of the relevant work. The phenomenon of adversarial instability was first introduced and studied in [18]. The authors estimated adversarial examples by solving penalized optimization problems and presented an analysis showing that the high complexity of neural networks might be a reason explaining the presence of adversarial examples. Unfortunately, the optimization method employed in [18] is time-consuming and therefore does not scale to large datasets. In [14], the authors showed that convolutional networks are not invariant to some sort of transformations based on the experiments done on Pascal3D+ annotations. Recently, Tsai et al. [19] provided a software to misclassify a given image in a specified class, without necessarily finding the smallest perturbation. Nguyen et al. [13] generated synthetic unrecognizable images, which are classified with high confidence. The authors of [3] also studied a related problem of finding the minimal geometric transformation that fools image classifiers, and provided quantitative measure of the robustness of classifiers to geometric transformations. Closer to our work, the authors of [4] introduced the “fast gradient sign” method, which computes the adversarial perturbations for a given classifier very efficiently. Despite its efficiency, this method provides only a coarse approximation of the optimal perturbation vectors. In fact, it performs a unique gradient step, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. Then in an attempt to build more robust classifiers to adversarial perturbations, [5] introduced a smoothness penalty in the training procedure that allows to boost the robustness of the classifier. Notably, the method in [18] was applied in order to generate adversarial perturbations. We should finally mention that the phenomenon of adversarial instability also led to theoretical work in [2] that studied the problem of adversarial perturbations on some families of classifiers, and provided upper bounds on the robustness of these classifiers. A deeper understanding of the phenomenon of adversarial instability for more complex classifiers is however needed; the method proposed in this work can be seen as a baseline to efficiently and accurately generate adversarial perturbations in order to better understand this phenomenon.Question: How is the authors' work different from the “fast gradient sign” method?","answer":"The fast gradient sign method is very quick but may lead to sub-optimal perturbations thus damaging the overall robustness estimation, and fine-tuning with such adversarial samples may sometimes result in a drop in the overall performance of the model. On the other hand, DeepFool creates adversarial perturbations that are closer to the absolute minimum compared to others thus giving us a more reliable tool in terms of robustness estimation and fine-tuning."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Initial results of the Italian PROSIT study . The likelihood of finding organ-confined untreated prostate cancer ( PCa ) by pathological examination at the time of radical prostatectomy ( RP ) is only 50 % in patients with clinically organ-confined disease . In addition , tumour is present at the resection margin in approximately 30 % of clinical T2 ( clinical stage B ) cases . The issue of clinical \\" understaging \\" and of resection limit positivity have led to the development of novel management practices , including \\" neoadjuvant \\" hormonal therapy ( NHT ) . The optimal duration of NHT is unknown . We undertook the present analysis to evaluate the effect of NHT on pathologic stage of PCa and resection limit status in patients with prostate cancer and treated with total androgen ablation either for three or six months before RP . Between January 1996 and February 1998 , 259 men with prostate cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic node dissection in the 26 centres participating in the Italian randomised prospective PROSIT study . Whole mount sectioning of the complete RP specimens was adopted in each centre for accurately evaluating the pathologic stage and resection limit status . By February 1998 , haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from 155 RP specimens had been received and evaluated by the reviewing pathologist ( RM ) . 64 cases had not been treated with total androgen ablation ( e.g . NHT ) before RP was performed , whereas 58 and 33 had been treated for three and six months , respectively . 114 patients were clinical stage B whereas 41 were clinical stage C. After three months of total androgen ablation , pathological stage B was more prevalent among patients with clinical B tumours , compared with untreated patients ( 57 % in treated patients vs. 36 % in untreated ) . The percentage of cancers with negative margins was statistically significantly greater in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy than those treated with immediate surgery alone ( 69 % vs. 42 % , respectively ) . After six months of NHT therapy the proportion of patients with pathological stage B ( 67 % vs. 36 % , respectively ) and negative margins was greater than after 3 months ( 92 % vs. 42 % , respectively ) . For clinical C tumours , the prevalence of pathological stage B and negative margins in the patients treated for either 3 or 6 months was not as high as in the clinical B tumours , when compared with the untreated group ( pathological stage B : 31 % and 33 % vs. 6 % in the clinical C cases , respectively . Negative margins : 56 % and 67 % vs. 31 % , respectively ) . The initial results of this study suggest that total androgen ablation before RP is beneficial in men with clinical stage B because of the significant pathological downstaging and decrease in the number of positive margins in the RP specimens . These two effects are more pronounced after six months of NHT than after three months of therapy . The same degree of beneficial effects are not observed in clinical C tumours .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"immediate surgery alone\\", \\"total androgen ablation\\", \\"radical prostatectomy ( RP )\\", \\"NHT\\", \\"RP\\", \\"neoadjuvant therapy\\", \\"total androgen ablation before\\", \\"radical retropubic prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic node dissection\\", \\"\\" neoadjuvant \\" hormonal therapy ( NHT )\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"pathologic stage and resection limit status of prostate cancer\\", \\"effect of NHT on pathologic stage of PCa and resection limit status\\", \\"beneficial effects\\", \\"negative margins\\", \\"pathological downstaging\\", \\"positive margins in the RP specimens\\", \\"proportion of patients with pathological stage B\\", \\"percentage of cancers with negative margins\\", \\"pathological stage B and negative margins\\", \\"pathological stage B\\", \\"pathologic stage and resection limit status\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"prostate cancer\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We investigated the transcriptional regulation of FDX1 in ovarian granulosa cells. Previously, we reported that the NR5A family, including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 could induce differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into steroidogenic cells. A ChIP assay showed that SF-1 could bind to the FDX1 promoter in differentiated hMSCs. Luciferase reporter assays showed that transcription of FDX1 was synergistically activated by the NR5A family and 8Br-cAMP treatment through two SF-1 binding sites and a CRE-like sequence in a human ovarian granulosa cell line, KGN. Knockdown of FDX1 attenuated progesterone production in KGN cells. These results indicate transcription of FDX1 is regulated by the NR5A family and cAMP signaling, and participates in steroid hormone production in ovarian granulosa cells.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"sulfur\\", \\"8Br-cAMP\\", \\"steroid hormone\\", \\"iron\\", \\"cAMP\\", \\"steroid\\", \\"progesterone\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"human ferredoxin 1\\", \\"SF-1\\", \\"NR5A\\", \\"FDX1 promoter\\", \\"CRE\\", \\"FDX1\\", \\"adrenodoxin\\", \\"liver receptor homolog-1\\", \\"steroidogenic factor-1\\", \\"Ferredoxin 1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

The anthracycline epirubicin has been investigated for intravesical use in patients with superficial bladder cancer. In multicentre, randomised trials, prophylaxis with intravesical epirubicin 30 to 80 mg after transurethral resection (TUR) was more effective than no prophylaxis in the prevention of disease recurrence. Intravesical prophylaxis with epirubicin was as effective as that with equivalent dosages of doxorubicin after TUR. Data are conflicting concerning the relative efficacy of intravesical epirubicin and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in patients at intermediate risk of recurrence after TUR, but epirubicin was less effective than BCG in those at high risk. The efficacy and tolerability of prophylaxis with epirubicin relative to that with mitomycin is not yet established. The efficacy of epirubicin as prophylaxis after TUR in combination with BCG or interferon-alpha-2b, or as treatment in patients with superficial bladder cancer has been evaluated in small, noncomparative trials, but requires clarification. Adverse events associated with intravesical epirubicin were generally mild and transient. The most common adverse events were localised to the bladder (cystitis, haematuria and urinary tract infection). Systemic adverse events (cardiac, haematological or related to hypersensitivity) were not reported in many trials of intravesical epirubicin, and when reported generally occurred in < or =5% of patients who received the drug. Intravesical epirubicin was generally tolerated as well as intravesical doxorubicin and was associated with a lower incidence of mild chemical cystitis in 1 clinical trial . The incidence of adverse events associated with intravesical epirubicin was markedly lower than that associated with intravesical BCG.  conclusions Intravesical epirubicin has shown efficacy in preventing disease recurrence after TUR of superficial bladder cancer. In comparison with equivalent dosages of doxorubicin, the efficacy of epirubicin for this indication is generally similar, and the tolerability profile may be more favourable. epirubicin is less effective than BCG as intravesical prophylaxis in patients at high risk of recurrence after TUR; the relative efficacy of epirubicin and BCG after TUR in patients at intermediate risk is not yet clear. Intravesical epirubicin is generally tolerated better than BCG. Intravesical epirubicin may be used as prophylaxis after TUR in patients who are at low or intermediate risk of recurrence of superficial bladder cancer.sentence: Intravesical epirubicin was generally tolerated as well as intravesical doxorubicin and was associated with a lower incidence of mild chemical cystitis in 1 clinical trial .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Several in vitro DNA microarray studies have shown the importance of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in skin sensitization. Nevertheless, the exact in vivo role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway during the induction of skin sensitization remains unknown. To study the function of Nrf2, a local lymph node assay was performed in wild-type and Nrf2-deficient mice using 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene.

Many explanations such as trial methods , environment or culture have been proposed , but this paper sets out to show that the main cause of the variability may be r and om chance , and that if trials are small their estimate of magnitude of effect may be incorrect , simply because of the r and om play of chance . This is highly relevant to the questions of ‘ How large do trials have to be for statistical accuracy ? ’ and ‘ How large do trials have to be for their results to be clinical ly valid ? ’ The true underlying control event rate ( CER ) and experimental event rate ( EER ) were determined from single‐dose acute pain analgesic trials in over 5000 patients . Trial group size required to obtain statistically significant and clinical ly relevant ( 0.95 probability of number‐needed‐to‐treat within ±0.5 of its true value ) results were computed using these values . Ten thous and trials using these CER and EER values were simulated using varying group sizes to investigate the variation due to r and om chance alone . Most common analgesics have EERs in the range 0.4–0.6 and CER of about 0.19 . With such efficacy , to have a 90 % chance of obtaining a statistically significant result in the correct direction requires group sizes in the range 30–60 . For clinical relevance nearly 500 patients are required in each group . Only with an extremely effective drug ( EER>0.8 ) will we be reasonably sure of obtaining a clinical ly relevant NNT with commonly used group sizes of around 40 patients per treatment arm . The simulated trials showed substantial variation in CER and EER , with the probability of obtaining the correct values improving as group size increased . We contend that much of the variability in control and experimental event rates is due to r and om chance alone . Single small trials are unlikely to be correct . If we want to be sure of getting correct ( clinical ly relevant ) results in clinical trials we must study more patients . Credible estimates of clinical efficacy are only likely to come from large trials or from pooling multiple trials of conventional ( small ) sizeTitle 2:Deriving dichotomous outcome measures from continuous data in randomised controlled trials of analgesics: verification from independent dataAbstract 2:Abstract A previously established relationship for deriving dichotomous from continuous information in r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of analgesics has been tested using an independent data set . Individual patient information from 18 RCTs of parallel‐group design in acute postoperative pain ( after abdominal , gynaecological and oral surgery ) was used to calculate the percentage of the maximum possible pain relief score  ( % maxTOTPAR ) and the proportion of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR for the different treatments . The relationship between the measures was investigated in 85 treatments with over 3400 patients . In 80 of 85 treatments ( 94 % ) agreement between calculated and actual number of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR was within four patients per treatment and in 72 ( 85 % ) was within three ( average of 40 patients per treatment , range 21–58 patients ) . Summing the positive and negative differences between actual and calculated numbers of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR gave an average difference of 0.30 patients per treatment arm . Reports of RCTs of analgesics frequently describe results of studies in the form of mean derived indices , rather than using discontinuous events , such as number or proportion of patients with 50 % pain relief . Because mean data inadequately describe information with a non‐normal distribution , combining mean data in systematic review s may compromise the results . Showing that dichotomous data can reliably be derived from mean data in acute pain studies enables data published as means to be used for quantitative systematic review s which require data in dichotomous formTitle 3:Deriving dichotomous outcome measures from continuous data in randomised controlled trials of analgesicsAbstract 3:& NA ; Reports of RCTs of analgesics frequently describe results of studies in the form of mean derived indices , rather than using discontinuous events — such as number or proportion of patients with 50 % pain relief . Because mean data inadequately describe information with a non‐normal distribution , combining mean data in systematic review s may compromise the results . Showing that dichotomous data can reliably be derived from mean data , at least in acute pain models , indicates that more meaningful overviews or meta‐ analysis may be possible . This study investigated the relationship between continuous and dichotomous analgesic measures in a set of individual patient data , and then used that relationship to derive dichotomous from continuous information in r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of analgesics .  Individual patient information from 13 RCTs of parallel‐group and crossover design in acute postoperative pain was used to calculate the percentage of the maximum possible pain relief score ( % maxTOTPAR ) and the proportion of patients with greater than 50 % pain relief ( > 50%maxTOTPAR ) for the different treatments . The relationship between the measures was investigated in 45 actual treatments and 10 000 treatments simulated using the underlying actual distribution ; 1283 patients had 45 separate treatments . Mean % maxTOTPAR correlated with the proportion of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR ( r2 = 0.90 ) . The relationship calculated from all the 45 treatments predicted to within three patients the number of patients with more than 50 % pain relief in 42 of 45 treatments , and 98.8 % of 10 000 simulated treatments . For seven effective treatments , actual numbers‐needed‐to‐treat ( NNT ) to achieve > 50%maxTOTPAR compared with placebo were very similar to those derived from calculated dataTitle 4:Developing a database of published reports of randomised clinical trials in pain research Abstract 4:& NA ; A data base of r and omised  clinical trials ( RCTs ) in pain research published from 1950 to 1990 was created following an extensive literature search . By applying a refined MEDLINE search strategy from 1966 to 1990 and by h and ‐ search ing more than 1 000 000 pages of a total of 40 biomedical journals published during the period 1950–1990 , more than 8000 RCTs were identified . The RCTs were published in more than 800 journals and over 85 % appeared between 1976 and 1990 . If the trend of the last 15 years persists , a total of more than 15 000 RCTs will be published in pain relief by the year 2000 . A detailed description of methods to ensure efficient use of re sources during the identification , retrieval and management of the information in pain relief and other fields is given . Emphasis is made on the importance of refining MEDLINE search strategies , on the use of volunteers to h and ‐ search journals and on careful monitoring of each of the steps of the process . The potential uses of the data base to guide clinical and research decisions are discussedTitle 5:The visual analogue pain intensity scale: what is moderate pain in millimetres?Abstract 5:Abstract One way to ensure adequate sensitivity for analgesic trials is to test the intervention on patients who have established pain of moderate to severe intensity . The usual criterion is at least moderate pain on a categorical pain intensity scale . When visual analogue scales ( VAS ) are the only pain measure in trials we need to know what point on a VAS represents moderate pain , so that these trials can be included in meta‐ analysis when baseline pain of at least moderate intensity is an inclusion criterion . To investigate this we used individual patient data from 1080 patients from r and omised controlled trials of various analgesics .  Baseline pain was measured using a 4‐point categorical pain intensity scale and a pain intensity VAS under identical conditions . The distribution of the VAS scores was examined for 736 patients reporting moderate pain and for 344 reporting severe pain .  The VAS scores corresponding to moderate or severe pain were also examined by gender . Baseline VAS scores recorded by patients reporting moderate pain were significantly different from those of patients reporting severe pain . Of the patients reporting moderate pain 85 % scored over 30 mm on the corresponding VAS , with a mean score of 49 mm . For those reporting severe pain 85 % scored over 54 mm with a mean score of 75 mm . There was no difference between the corresponding VAS scores of men and women . Our results indicate that if a patient records a baseline VAS score in excess of 30 mm they would probably have recorded at least moderate pain on a 4‐point categorical scale","answer":"AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS In the absence of evidence of efficacy , at present , for oral nabumetone in acute postoperative pain , its use in this indication is not justified ."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

However, these systems may also enclose potential conflicts and unintended consequences. Notably, people will only adopt an A.I. system if it confers them an advantage, at which point non-adopters might push for a strong regulation if that advantage for adopters is at a cost for them. Here we propose a stochastic game theoretical model for these conflicts. We frame our results under the current discussion on ethical A.I. and the conflict between individual and societ al gains, the societ al value alignment problem. We test the arising equilibria in the adoption of A.I. technology under different norms followed by artificial agents, their ensuing benefits, and the emergent levels of wealth inequality. We show that without any regulation, purely selfish A.I. systems will have the strongest advantage, even when a utilitarian A.I. provides a more significant benefit for the individual and the society. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to develop human conscious A.I. systems that reach an equilibrium where the gains for the adopters are not at a cost for non-adopters while increasing the overall fitness and lowering inequality. However, as shown, a self-organized adoption of such policies would require external regulation.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: What happens when machines become more intelligent than humans? One view is that this event will be followed by an explosion to ever-greater levels of intelligence, as each generation of machines creates more intelligent machines in turn. This intelligence explosion is now often known as the “singularity”. The basic argument here was set out by the statistician I. J. Good in his 1965 article “Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine”:[2]: [3]: Part 1 The foundations of foresight: engines of construction the principles of change predicting and projecting. Part 2 Profiles of the possible: engines of abundance thinking machines the world beyond Earth engines of healing long life in an open world a door to the future the limits to growth. Part 3 Dangers and hopes: engines of destruction strategies and survival finding the facts the network of knowledge world enough and time.[4]: Machine ethics and robot rights are quickly becoming hot topics in artificial intelligence robotics communities. We will argue that the attempts to allow machines to make ethical decisions or to have rights are misguided. Instead we propose a new science of safety engineering for intelligent artificial agents. In particular we issue a challenge to the scientific community to develop intelligent systems capable of proving that they are in fact safe even under recursive self-improvement.[5]: Machine ethics and robot rights are quickly becoming hot topics in artificial intelligence and robotics communities. We will argue that attempts to attribute moral agency and assign rights to all intelligent machines are misguided, whether applied to infrahuman or superhuman AIs, as are proposals to limit the negative effects of AIs by constraining their behavior. As an alternative, we propose a new science of safety engineering for intelligent artificial agents based on maximizing for what humans value. In particular, we challenge the scientific community to develop intelligent systems that have human-friendly values that they provably retain, even under recursive self-improvement.[6]: [7]: With almost daily improvements in capabilities of artificial intelligence it is more important than ever to develop safety software for use by the AI research community. Building on our previous work on AI Containment Problem we propose a number of guidelines which should help AI safety researchers to develop reliable sandboxing software for intelligent programs of all levels. Such safety container software will make it possible to study and analyze intelligent artificial agent while maintaining certain level of safety against information leakage, social engineering attacks and cyberattacks from within the container.","answer":"However, some argue that having an ethical framework or even A.I. systems that pass the comparative moral Turing test is not enough [4] . Roman Yampolskiy defends that it is insufficient to have a human-like morality on A.I. systems with super-human intelligence. On such agents, small moral mistakes, common in humans, could lead to the extinction of humanity. Furthermore, a moral A.I. system with super-human intelligence will be able to recursively self-improve, with no provided guarantees that the resulting improvements remain moral. Instead of an ethical approach, Yampolskiy proposes a safety engineering approach, able to provide proofs that developed A.I. systems will remain safe, even under recursive self-improvement [5] . Yampolskiy also proposes A.I. confinement as a possible approach while no safety guarantees are in place [7] [2] . This approach would consist in ensuring that an A.I. system could help humanity while having no ability to negatively influence the world around it. This idea of A.I. confinement had been first presented in [3] , and discussed by Bostrom [6] and Chalmers [1] . This is, however, more of a preventive measure than a perfect solution, as limiting the negative A.I. influence will also limit the possible positive influence."},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Numerousoncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been identified to directly contribute to thedevelopment and maintenance of transformed cellular states.1 During the past three decades, various types oftargeted therapies (e.g. kinase inhibitors and hormonal therapies) have been developedfor various types of cancers.2 However,most of these therapies face a formidable challenge of rapidly developed drug-resistancethrough up-regulating alternative cellular survival pathways.3,4Therefore, identifying and targeting novel regulators of cancer development andmaintenance have been the subject of intense cancer biology and chemical biology studiesincluding those from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.5 Among these novel targets are transcriptionfactors that are deregulated in various cancer cells.6</p><p>Cyclic-AMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) is a stimulus-activatedtranscription factor.7 CREB normallyresides in the nucleus in an inactive state.8 Upon phosphorylation at Ser133 by various kinases including proteinkinase A (PKA), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90RSK)and Ras-activated mitogen activated protein kinases, CREB's transcriptionactivity is initiated by recruiting CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its closely relatedparalog p300 and other proteins in the transcription machinery to the genepromoters.9,10 Similar to other phosphorylated proteins, CREBphosphorylation is dynamic and tightly regulated to ensure its transcription activity istightly coupled to the environment cues. Three protein phosphatases have been identifiedto be able to dephosphorylate CREB to inactivate its transcription activity. These areprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1),11 proteinphosphatase 2A12 and phosphatase andtensin homolog (PTEN)13.Mechanistically, the kinases that can phosphorylate and activate CREB areproto-oncogenes that are often overactivated in tumor cells while those phosphatasesthat can dephosphorylate CREB are known as tumor suppressors that are often inactivatedor deleted in tumor cells. As a consequence, CREB is often overactivated in cancer cellsto drive tumor development and maintenance. Indeed, this overactivation has beenobserved in numerous cancer tissues.9,14–16</p><p>Because CREB sits at a signaling hub of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways andis overactivated in many cancer tissues, CREB has been recognized as an importantoncology drug targets.9 We and othershave been investigating small molecule inhibitors of CREB as potential cancertherapeutics.9,17–25 Among these, 666-15 (Figure 1) represents the most potent inhibitor of CREB-mediated genetranscription with efficacious in vitro and in vivoanti-breast cancer activity without harming normal cellular homeostasis.20,26 Preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) studiesidentified the following (Figure 1): 1) thenaphthyl rings A and B are critical for activity; 2) minor alterations of the two carbonlinkers C and D can dramatically affect the CREB inhibition activity; and 3) the primaryamino group is essential for optimal CREB inhibition.20 In this communication, we describe ourinvestigation on the SAR of region B with different regioisomers by varying onesubstitution at a time on naphthalene ring B. By keeping the carboxamide substitution atposition 2, two isomers 1a and 1b (Figure 2) were designed by moving the alkoxy group to position1 and 4, respectively. On the other hand, by maintaining the alkoxy group at position 3,isomers 1c and 1d (Figure2) were designed through changing the carboxamide substitution to position 4and 1, respectively.</p><p>The general strategy to the synthesis of regioisomers 1a–1dis similar to our previously described synthesis of 666-15.20 The key is to synthesize buildingblocks 4a–4d (Scheme 1) andthen couple them to the same amine 8 (Scheme2). The carboxylic acids 4a–4d were synthesizedaccording to Scheme 1. Compounds2a–2c are either commercially available or couldbe conveniently synthesized from their corresponding acids by acid-catalyzedesterification reaction as described before.17 The Boc-protected aminopropyl side chain was either installedby Mitsunobu reaction (for 3a) with alcohol orO-alkylation reaction with bromide (for 3b and3c) to give ethers 3a–3c, which were furthersaponified by LiOH or NaOH to generate required acids 4a–4c. A moreelaborate scheme to prepare 4d was needed (Scheme 1). The acid 7 was synthesized by a reportedprocedure27 with slightmodifications. Briefly, 1,8-naphthoic anhydride was nitrated byHNO3/H2SO4 followed by mercury-mediateddecarboxylation of the resulting anhydride (Pesci reaction) and acidic hydrolysis togive the mono-acid 6. Direct reduction of the nitro group in 6with iron resulted in only low yield of the corresponding aniline. However, reduction ofthe methyl ester of 6 gave 95% yield of the corresponding aniline,which was further converted into naphthol 7 through a diazonium salt andconcomitant hydrolysis of the methyl ester. The requisite building block 4dwas prepared by Mitsunobu reaction followed by saponification (Scheme 1). With all the building blocks4a–4d in hand, they were each coupled to amine820 withEDCI/HOBt as the coupling reagents to give Boc-protected amides9a–9d (Scheme 2). Finalremoval of Boc protecting group from 9a–9d provided desiredcompounds 1a–1d in good to excellent yields.28</p><p>With the designed regioisomers 1a–1d in hand, we firstevaluated their potency in inhibiting CREB-mediated gene transcription in living HEK293T cells using our previously described CREB transcription reporter assay.29 This reporter assay involvedtransfecting HEK 293T cells with a reporter construct, which expressesrenilla luciferase with three tandem copies of CRE sequence in thepromoter region to report CREB's transcription activity in living cells. Thenthe transfected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of different compounds(50 nM to 50 Î¼M) followed by stimulation with forskolin (10 Î¼M) tostimulate CREB phosphorylation and transcription activity. The relative luciferaseactivity was used to report CREB's transcription activity. We have previouslyshown that 666-15 had an IC50 of ~ 80 nM in thistranscription reporter assay.20 Asshown in Table 1, moving the aminopropoxy groupfrom position 3 in 666-15 to position 1 (1a, IC50= 23.98 ± 16.02 μM) or 4 (1b, IC50= 17.25 ± 3.90 μM) resulted in significantly decreased CREBinhibition activity. Similarly, relocation of the carboxamide from position 2 in666-15 to 4 (1c, IC50 = 18.94 ±5.35 μM) or 1 (1d, IC50 = 19.03 ± 10.96Î¼M) also dramatically attenuated the inhibitory activity. These results showthat the substitution pattern on naphthalene ring B is absolutely critical indetermining the CREB inhibition activity. Previously, we have shown that666-15 adopted a compact conformation at its global energy minimum (seealso Figure 3A).20 To investigate if the regioisomers1a–1d also adopt such a compact conformation attheir global energy minimum, a conformational search was performed for compounds1a–1d using the same protocol we did before.20 Similar to 666-15, thepositively charged ammonium group in 1a–1d all hydrogen bonded withthe carbonyl oxygen (Figure 3B–2E). The naphthalene ring B in1a–1d also forms π-stacking interaction with thechlorophenyl ring, effectively forming a compact conformation similar to what isobserved in 666-15. However, as the substitution pattern in the naphthaleneB changes, the relative orientation of the two-carbon linker D and naphthalene ring Bvary greatly compared to 666-15 (Figure3F). These results suggest that the unique arrangement of different groups in666-15 forming the potential bioactive pharmacophore can not be alteredwithout losing bioactivity.</p><p>We also assessed the cancer cell growth inhibition activities of1a–1d in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Asshown in Table 1, all four regioisomers showsignificantly less potent activity than 666-15. These results areconsistent with their reduced potency in inhibiting CREB-mediated gene transcription.However, distinct differences exist for 1a–1d between the twodifferent assays. The growth inhibitory activity of 1a–1d in thesebreast cancer cell lines is in general higher than their CREB inhibition potency. Thisdifference suggests that 1a–1d may be endowed with activitiesindependent of CREB inhibition in the cells. This possibility is likely because theconformations accessible for 1a–1d can be dramatically differentfrom those of 666-15 due to the differential substitution pattern innaphthalene ring B.</p><p>In this study, we designed, synthesized and evaluated regioisomers of666-15, a potent CREB inhibitor with robust anti-breast cancer efficacywithout harming normal body homeostasis. Our results showed that the alkoxy andcarboxamide substitution pattern in naphthalene ring B of 666-15 isabsolutely critical for maintaining potent CREB inhibition and anti-proliferativeactivity in breast cancer cells. These results reinforced that the unique bioactiveconformation accessible only in 666-15 is the key for its potent activity.Further studies of SAR of 666-15 should keep this unique pharmacophoreintact.</p>","answer":"cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is a nuclear transcription factor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis and maintenance of various types of human cancers.

The previous graph neural network (GNN) approaches in few-shot learning have been based on the node-labeling framework, which implicitly models the intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. In contrast, the proposed EGNN learns to predict the edge-labels rather than the node-labels on the graph that enables the evolution of an explicit clustering by iteratively updating the edge-labels with direct exploitation of both intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. It is also well suited for performing on various numbers of classes without retraining, and can be easily extended to perform a transductive inference. The parameters of the EGNN are learned by episodic training with an edge-labeling loss to obtain a well-generalizable model for unseen low-data problem. On both of the supervised and semi-supervised few-shot image classification tasks with two benchmark datasets, the proposed EGNN significantly improves the performances over the existing GNNs.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: Learning from a few examples remains a key challenge in machine learning. Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6 to 93.2 and from 88.0 to 93.8 on Omniglot compared to competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same model on language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.[3]: People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms—for action, imagination, and explanation. We present a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world’s alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We also present several “visual Turing tests” probing the model’s creative generalization abilities, which in many cases are indistinguishable from human behavior.[4]: We propose prototypical networks for the problem of few-shot classification, where a classifier must generalize to new classes not seen in the training set, given only a small number of examples of each new class. Prototypical networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning. We further extend prototypical networks to zero-shot learning and achieve state-of-the-art results on the CU-Birds dataset.","answer":"One main stream approach for few-shot image classification is based on representation learning and does prediction by using nearest-neighbor according to similarity between representations. The similarity can be a simple distance function such as cosine or Euclidean distance. A Siamese network [1] works in a pairwise manner using trainable weighted @math distance. A matching network [2] further uses an attention mechanism to derive an differentiable nearest-neighbor classifier and a prototypical network [4] extends it with defining prototypes as the mean of embedded support examples for each class. DEML [3] has introduced a concept learner to extract high-level concept by using a large-scale auxiliary labeled dataset showing that a good representation is an important component to improve the performance of few-shot image classification."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Identification of the FMR1 gene and the repeat-amplification mechanism causing fragile X syndrome led to development of reliable DNA-based diagnostic methods, including Southern blot hybridization and PCR. Both methods are performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells and measure the repeat size in FMR1. Using an immunocytochemical technique on blood smears, we recently developed a novel test for identification of patients with fragile X syndrome. This method, also called \\" antibody test, \\" uses monoclonal antibodies against the FMR1 gene product (FMRP) and is based on absence of FMRP in patients cells. Here we describe a new diagnostic test to identify male patients with fragile X syndrome, on the basis of lack of FMRP in their hair roots. Expression of FMRP in hair roots was studied by use of an FMRP-specific antibody test, and the percentage of FMRP-expressing hair roots in controls and in male fragile X patients was determined. Control individuals showed clear expression of FMRP in nearly every hair root, whereas male fragile X patients lacked expression of FMRP in almost all their hair roots. Mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed FMRP expression in only some of their hair roots (< 55%), and no overlap with normal female controls was observed. The advantages of this test are (1) plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the mentally retarded patient, (2) hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center, and (3) the result of the test is available within 5 h of plucking. In addition, this test enabled us to identify two fragile X patients who did not show the full mutation by analysis of DNA isolated from blood cells..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"fragile X syndrome\\", \\"Mentally retarded\\", \\"mentally retarded\\", \\"fragile X\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

These results demonstrate that selenoproteins and selenium metabolism are regulated at multiple levels in prostate cellsIn a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration.Our results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies.This study provides evidence that SEP15 genetic variation may influence PCa mortality. Additionally, the association of selenium with PCa mortality was modified by a variant, suggesting the possibility that some men with PCa may benefit more from selenium than others, depending on their genotype.We conclude that decreased SEPP concentration in serum might represent an additional valuable marker for prostate cancer diagnostics.The recently completed Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) was one of the largest human cancer prevention trials ever undertaken. Its purpose was to assess the role of selenium and vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention, but SELECT found no decline in prostate cancer.We studied Se levels in whole blood, plasma and prostate of 32 PC and 40 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and in the control group composed of 39 healthy subjects. The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was also measured in the patients' red cells, plasma and prostate tissue. Se concentration in whole blood and plasma in both groups of patients was lower as compared with controls, while in prostate gland it was significantly higher in PC than in BPH patients and controls. Red cell GSH-Px activity was the same in PC patients and controls but significantly lower in BPH patients.Of particular interest was the positive correlation between tissue GPx activity and Gleason score, with this relationship achieving statistical significance among African-Americans (r = 0.67, P = 0.02)","answer":"no"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Organs such as the eye and brain are immunologically privileged. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is essential for maintaining ocular immune privilege. Deletion of multiple autophagy genes in macrophages leads to an inflammation-mediated eye disease called uveitis that can cause blindness. Loss of autophagy activates inflammasome -mediated IL1B secretion that increases disease severity.

We hypothesized that silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase that activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and mediating the beneficial effect of EPO. Our study in human cardiomyocyte AC16 cells showed that DOX - induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction, as manifested by decreased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased mitochondrial superoxide accumulation, can be mitigated by EPO pretreatment. EPO was found to upregulate SIRT1 activity and protein expression to reverse DOX - induced acetylation of PGC-1α and suppression of a suite of PGC-1α - activated genes involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesis, such as nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), citrate synthase (CS), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), cytochrome c oxidase IV (COXIV), and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Silencing of SIRT1 via small RNA interference sensitized AC16 cells to DOX - induced cytotoxicity and reduction in mtDNA copy number. Although with SIRT1 silenced, EPO could reverse to some extent DOX - induced mitochondrial superoxide accumulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP depletion, it failed to normalize protein expression of PGC-1α and its downstream genes. Taken together, our results indicated that EPO may activate SIRT1 to enhance mitochondrial function and protect against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"cardiomyocyte\\", \\"cardiomyocytes\\", \\"SIRT1\\", \\"genes\\", \\"sensitized AC16 cells\\", \\"AC16 cells\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"mitochondrial membrane potential\\", \\"suppression\\", \\"silenced\\", \\"Silencing\\", \\"cytotoxicity\\", \\"upregulate\\", \\"acetylation\\", \\"protein expression\\", \\"RNA interference\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"mtDNA\\", \\"silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1\\", \\"doxorubicin\\", \\"EPO\\", \\"SOD2\\", \\"DOX\\", \\"cytochrome c oxidase IV\\", \\"ATP\\", \\"TFAM\\", \\"nuclear respiratory factor-1\\", \\"COXIV\\", \\"NRF1\\", \\"erythropoietin\\", \\"mitochondrial superoxide\\", \\"CS\\", \\"mitochondrial DNA\\", \\"Erythropoietin\\", \\"citrate synthase\\", \\"SIRT1\\", \\"VDAC\\", \\"hormone\\", \\"NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase\\", \\"PGC-1u03b1\\", \\"peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha\\", \\"superoxide dismutase 2\\", \\"mitochondrial transcription factor A\\", \\"voltage-dependent anion channel\\", \\"drug\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"human\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"accumulation\\", \\"mitochondrial dysfunction\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"chemotherapy\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"toxicity\\", \\"cardiotoxicity\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"downstream\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Clinical studies indicate that selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may decrease alcohol intake and craving in particular subgroups of alcoholics. The aim of the present study was to compare the behavioral profile of various SSRIs in alcohol-preferring cAA rats, a genetic model of alcoholism. The effects of acute IP administration of fluoxetine (doses in mg/kg 1-10), citalopram (3-30), fluvoxamine (3-30) and paroxetine (1-10) on ethanol (EtOH) intake and preference, as well as food and total fluid intake, were determined in a 12-h access, water vs. 10% v/v EtOH two-bottle choice paradigm. Each compound reduced EtOH intake [Minimal Effective Doses (MEDs) 5, 10, 30 and 1 mg/kg for fluoxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine, respectively]. The degree of selectivity, that is, the extent to which reductions in EtOH intake could be separated from reductions in food and/or total fluid intake varied across the compounds. Thus, whereas EtOH intake was more markedly affected than food intake by fluoxetine, both parameters were equally affected by citalopram, and food intake was more markedly affected than EtOH intake by fluvoxamine and paroxetine. The anti-alcohol effect also differed with respect to specificity, that is, the degree to which effects on EtOH intake coincided with effects on EtOH preference. Whereas fluoxetine showed the highest level of specificity , followed by citalopram and fluvoxamine , the effect of paroxetine was nonspecific . The observed variation in the degree of selectivity and specificity of the anti-alcohol effect of SSRIs suggests that reductions in EtOH intake are not merely a consequence of a general suppressive effect on consummatory behavior. It is hypothesized that differences between the behavioral profiles of these compounds reflect a differential involvement of 5-HT receptor subtypes.sentence: Whereas fluoxetine showed the highest level of specificity , followed by citalopram and fluvoxamine , the effect of paroxetine was nonspecific .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

The IONDT is a single-masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.                Patients were evaluated and followed up at 25 clinical centers located throughout the United States. Data were sent to and analyzed at a central coordinating center.                Two hundred fifty-eight patients 50 years or older with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and visual acuity of 20/64 or worse, but better than no light perception, were randomized to either a careful follow-up group (n=131) or an optic nerve decompression surgery (ONDS) group (n=127). Of these, 174 continued participation for at least 24 months, 89 in the careful follow-up group and 85 in the ONDS group.                Randomized patients underwent a standard visual acuity examination at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up. The primary outcome was a change of 3 lines or more of visual acuity, defined as a difference of 0.3 in logMAR scores, between baseline and 6 months of follow-up. A secondary outcome was mean change in visual acuity (in logMAR units) at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following baseline. These changes were estimated using available data from all randomized patients for whom we had data.                Of the 258 patients randomized, 143 (55.4%) were male, and 169 (65.5%) were 65 years or older. Mean visual acuity was statistically significantly improved from baseline value at all study visits and for both treatment groups, although visual acuity declined gradually in both groups after the 3-month visit. There were no significant differences between careful follow-up and ONDS in mean change in vision from the baseline and any follow-up time point. At 24 months of follow-up, 31.0% of patients in the careful follow-up group and 29.4% of patients in the ONDS group experienced an increase of 3 or more lines of vision compared with baseline acuity; 21.8% of patients in the careful follow-up group and 20.0% of patients in the ONDS group experienced a decrease of 3 or more lines. In patients who could read at least 1 letter on the Lighthouse chart, there was a gradual decline in mean visual acuity noted over time for both treatment groups, although acuity remained significantly better than at baseline.                Analysis of visual acuity data from patients enrolled in the IONDT at 24 months of follow-up confirms that there is no benefit of ONDS compared with careful follow-up in patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

The tetrahydropyridine ring is an essential building block for numerous natural products, synthetic pharmaceuticals, and various biologically active compounds [17]. The tetrahydropyridine scaffold is inherent for pharmacologically relevant representatives [18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. At the same time, heterocyclic systems containing an annulated pyridinium core, such as quinolinium and isoquinolinium salts, are of considerable importance as building blocks for the synthesis of various alkaloid frameworks [10,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35].</p><p>During the past decade the reaction of dinucleophiles with dielectrophiles has been a major research subject in both our laboratories. For example, we have studied reactions of quinolinium [36,37], isoquinolinium [38][39][40], quinazolinium [41,42] and quinoxalinium [43] salts with 1,3-bis(silyl enol ethers), i.e., masked 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, which provided facile access to a number of bicyclic systems. Some of these reactions, such as the cyclization with quinazolinium salts, proceeded as one-pot cyclizations. Other cyclizations, such as the reaction with isoquinolinium salts, had to be carried out in two steps (formation of open-chained condensation products, which are subsequently cyclized by the addition of acid). In some cases the cyclization step failed, e.g., the reaction of 1,3-bis(silyl enol ethers) with pyridine in the presence of methyl chloroformate resulted in the formation of 1,4-dihydropyridines, which however, could not be cyclized by the addition of acid due to decomposition [36]. Additionally, we have shown a broad application of the quinolinium [44][45][46][47][48] and isoquinolinium [49] salts for the synthesis of a wide variety of alkaloid-like frameworks.</p>Reaction optimization<p>During the course of the above-mentioned study we discovered an interesting reaction that represents an external dinucleophilic addition of the dimedone molecule to the pyridinium salt 2a, taken as a random example, delivering 8-oxa-10-azatricyclo[7.3.1.0 2,7 ]trideca-2(7),11-diene (3a) in modest yield (Scheme 1). Previously, we have communicated a similar cycloaddition reaction using quinolinium salts [45], and recently Li and Yan [50] reported this reaction with phenanthrolinium salts. Scheme 1: Reagents and conditions: (i) CH 3 CN, K 2 CO 3 , rt, 24 h. Scheme 2: Synthesis of compounds 3-8. Reagents and conditions: (i): CH 3 CN, K 2 CO 3 , rt, 24 h. In the case of 3-cyanopyridinium salts, NaHCO 3 (2 equiv) was used as a base and the reaction time was 4 days.</p><p>This efficient cycloaddition encouraged us to investigate this process, to improve the reaction conditions, and to extend the reaction with other pyridinium salts and diketones. Herein we report the results of that study. First, we studied the reaction of pyridinium salt 2a with dimedone (1a) using various bases in different solvents (Table 1). At the same time, different ratios of 1a and 2a were examined. To reach the optimal yields, dimedone and pyridinium salt 2a should be used in a ratio of two to one. In addition, the optimization study showed the essential role of a non-nucleophilic base as well as that of the potassium cation.</p><p>This optimization study afforded a general procedure and optimal reaction conditions: 2.0 mmol of diketone, 1.0 mmol of the appropriate pyridinium salt and 1 mmol of K 2 CO 3 in 7 mL of CH 3 CN are stirred at room temperature for 24 hours.</p>Reaction scope<p>Having found the optimal reaction conditions, we concentrated on studying the scope and limitations of the discovered cycloaddition. A variety of pyridinium salts with different substituents in positions 1, 2, 3 and 4 were prepared by alkylation of the parental commercially available pyridines (see Supporting Information File 1, Table S1). The results of this cyclization reaction (Scheme 2) are summarized in Figure 1. Generally the reaction was complete in 24 hours and afforded the desired products in good to excellent yields. It is worth mentioning that only cyclohexanediones were prone to reaction with the tested pyridinium salts with formation of the corresponding tetracyclic products 3, 4, 6 and 7. In the frame of the current project a variety of 1,3-diketones and CF 3 -containing  At the same time, to our great disappointment 4-substituted pyridinium salts appeared to be unreactive, and testing different reaction conditions as well as bases with various combinations of time and temperature did not deliver any positive results.</p><p>During the course of this work we encountered the low stability of 8-oxa-10-aza-tricyclo[7.3.1.0 2,7 ]trideca-2(7),11-dienes; decomposition was observed in polar solvents, i.e., in DMSO. In some cases this had an influence on the quality of the 1 H NMR spectra. Heating also led to decomposition, which was observed after 2-3 hours at 60-70 °C.</p><p>The constitution of products 3, 4, 6, 7 was proven by 1D and 2D NMR experiments; that of compounds 6d, 7c and 8 was unambiguously corroborated by X-ray [51] diffraction analysis (Supporting Information File 1, Figures S2, S3, S4)</p>Reaction mechanism<p>In order to shed light on the reaction mechanism we used DFT computations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) [52][53][54] level, as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program [55], and acetonitrile was included implicitly within the IEFPCM method (more details on inclusion of the solvent can be found in Supporting Information File 2). For simplicity 1,3-cyclohexanedione rather than dimedone was included in the computations.</p><p>Our ability to calculate the mechanism as well as to make any further predictions about reaction products is limited by the obscure structure of the real reaction product. In fact the reaction of pyridinium salt 2a with cyclic 1,3-diketones in the presence of either K 2 CO 3 or DIPEA/KI yields an orange precipitate in acetonitrile. Redissolved in DMSO-d 6 , this precipitate gave rise to broad peaks in the 1 H NMR spectra; thus its structure was not defined and is supposed to be of polymeric nature. Potassium with a counter-ion (HCO 3 − or I − ) is also included in the precipitate since that cannot be burned completely and yields an unburned material. On the other hand the orange precipitate is quickly decomposed by silica gel liberating the desired product 3a or 6a, which was finally eluted from silica.</p><p>The formation of a precipitate must be a driving force of the reaction promoted by DIPEA/KI (see Supporting Information File 2, thermodynamic analysis).</p><p>The reaction starts with 1,3-diketone deprotonation and nucleophilic attack of potassium 3-oxocyclohex-1-enolate on pyridinium cation, which yields an intermediate with a new C-C bond, and this is a key stage in the reaction. The C-O bond formation can be excluded in the initial stage (see Supporting Information File 2 for the explanation). Bearing this in mind, we computed the local softness of 3-acetyl-1-methylpyridinium (2a + ), 2-cyano-1-methylpyridinium (2b + ) and 3-cyano-1methylpyridinium (2e + ) cations towards nucleophilic attack.</p><p>According to the local softness indexes (see Supporting Information File 2) with 2b + cation we should observe a regioselective formation of product 4a or 7a, while for cations 2a + and 2e + a regioisomeric mixture should be expected (but is really only observed for 2e + ). In reality, regioisomeric mixtures of compounds 3/5 or 6/8 are produced by cation 2e + , while for cations 2a + and 2b + regioselective reaction is inherent.</p><p>Intrigued by this discrepancy, we computed the full reaction mechanism for cation 2a + with potassium 3-oxocyclohex-1enolate in the presence of potassium cation and hydrogencarbonate anion as base. We included HCO 3 − in our computation, both because it has only five atoms and because this base is presumed to operate; it is formed from neutral carbonate when it deprotonates the cyclic diketone. However, the mechanism involving any other base should not differ significantly.</p><p>A plausible mechanism is presented in Figure 2. After initial deprotonation of the diketone and formation of the hydrogencarbonate anion, the latter is exchanged with iodine in the salt of 2a, and an initial complex consisting of 2a + HCO Other TSs (K-S1a-2, K-S1a-3, see Supporting Information File 2), inherent for the initial stage of new C-C bond formation turned out to be unimportant, because in both cases reactions run again through TS 22a (rate limiting), as was shown by additional computations. On the other hand, we have computed four conformers of TS 22: the conformation of the cyclohexane ring and that of the acetyl group were changed. While the cyclohexane-ring conformation has only a negligible effect on the TS energy (TS 22b, see Supporting Information File 2), the change of the acetyl group conformation prevents potassium from coordinating to it and makes the TS energy somewhat higher (TSs 22c and 22d from Supporting Information File 2).</p><p>In the proposed mechanism the regioselective formation of product 6a is not explained (see Supporting Information File 2 for discussion). We attribute this to a higher thermodynamic stabilization of compound 6a by a potassium cation (Scheme 3), as compared with that of regioisomeric 6aa (its formation was not observed); the energetic distance between 6a-K + and 6aa-K + is 2.5 kcal/mol at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level and 2.0 kcal/mol at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. As mentioned before, the assumption is hard to prove due to lack of information about the real product composition.</p>Scheme 3:<p>The influence of K + on the product free energy.</p>Conclusion<p>In summary, we have studied the dicomponent binucleophilic cycloaddition of 1,3-diketones with diverse substituted pyridinium salts.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  An ad hoc wireless network is an autonomous self-organizing system ofmobile nodes connected by wireless links where nodes not in directrange can communicate via intermediate nodes. A common technique usedin routing protocols for ad hoc wireless networks is to establish therouting paths on-demand, as opposed to continually maintaining acomplete routing table. A significant concern in routing is theability to function in the presence of byzantine failures whichinclude nodes that drop, modify, or mis-route packets in an attempt todisrupt the routing service.We propose an on-demand routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks that provides resilience to byzantine failures caused by individual or colluding nodes. Our adaptive probing technique detects a malicious link after log n faults have occurred, where n is the length of the path. These links are then avoided by multiplicatively increasing their weights and by using an on-demand route discovery protocol that finds a least weight path to the destination. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We consider routing security in wireless sensor networks. Many sensor network routing protocols have been proposed, but none of them have been designed with security as a goal. We propose security goals for routing in sensor networks, show how attacks against ad-hoc and peer-to-peer networks can be adapted into powerful attacks against sensor networks, introduce two classes of novel attacks against sensor networks sinkholes and HELLO floods, and analyze the security of all the major sensor network routing protocols. We describe crippling attacks against all of them and suggest countermeasures and design considerations. This is the first such analysis of secure routing in sensor networks. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly emerging as an important new area in wireless and mobile computing research. Applications of WSNs are numerous and growing, and range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office to outdoor deployment scenarios in adversary's territory in a tactical battleground (Akyildiz et al., 2002). For military environment, dispersal of WSNs into an adversary's territory enables the detection and tracking of enemy soldiers and vehicles. For home/office environments, indoor sensor networks offer the ability to monitor the health of the elderly and to detect intruders via a wireless home security system. In each of these scenarios, lives and livelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of the sensor data obtained from dispersed sensor nodes. As a result, such WSNs must be secured to prevent an intruder from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and from forging sensor data. To address the latter problem, end-to-end data integrity checksums and post-processing of senor data can be used to identify forged sensor data (Estrin et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2003a; Ye et al., 2004). The focus of this chapter is on routing security in WSNs. Most of the currently existing routing protocols for WSNs make an optimization on the limited capabilities of the nodes and the application-specific nature of the network, but do not any the security aspects of the protocols. Although these protocols have not been designed with security as a goal, it is extremely important to analyze their security properties. When the defender has the liabilities of insecure wireless communication, limited node capabilities, and possible insider threats, and the adversaries can use powerful laptops with high energy and long range communication to attack the network, designing a secure routing protocol for WSNs is obviously a non-trivial task.Literature Review:","answer":"The physical layer is responsible for frequency selection, carrier frequency generation, signal detection, modulation, and data encryption  . Jamming in the physical layer is the most usual way to launch a DoS attack. In the jamming attack, the attacker interferes with the radio frequencies that the nodes in a WSN use for communication BIB001 . The jamming attack is extremely catastrophic. Even with a less powerful jamming source, an adversary can potentially disrupt communication in an entire network by strategically distributing the sources of the jamming signal. through a single malicious node. In the wormhole attack, a pair of malicious nodes first creates a wormhole. A wormhole is a low-latency link between two portions of a network over which one attacker node replays messages to the other attacker node BIB003 . This link may be established either by a single node forwarding messages between two adjacent but otherwise non-neighboring nodes or by a pair of nodes in different parts of a network communicating with each other. The latter case is closely related to the sinkhole attack as an attacking node near the base station can provide a one-hop link to that base station via the other attacking node in a distant part of the network. In the blackhole attack, a malicious node falsely advertises good paths (e.g., the shortest path or the most stable path) to the destination node during the path-finding process in reactive routing protocols, or in the route update messages in proactive routing protocols. The intention of the malicious node could be to hinder the path-finding process or to intercept all data packets sent to the concerned destination node. A more delicate form of this attack is known as the grayhole attack, in which the malicious node intermittently drops data packets thereby making its detection more difficult. In an HELLO flood attack, an attacker may use a high-powered transmitter to fool a large number of nodes and make them believe that they are within its neighborhood BIB003 . Subsequently, the attacker node falsely broadcasts a shorter route to the base station and all the nodes that received the HELLO packets attempt to transmit to the attacker node. However, since these nodes are out of the radio range of the attacker, no communication will be established. In the Byzantine attack, a single compromised node or a set of compromised nodes works in collusion and carries out attacks by creating routing loops, forwarding packets through suboptimal routes, and selectively dropping packets BIB002 . These attacks are very difficult to detect since under such attacks, the networks usually do not exhibit any abnormal behavior. In an information disclosure attack, a compromised node leaks confidential or important information to unauthorized nodes in the network. Such information may include information regarding the network topology, geographic location of nodes, or optimal routes to authorized nodes in the network. In resource depletion attack, a malicious node attempts to deplete resources of other nodes in the network. The typical resources that are targeted are battery power, bandwidth, and computational power. The attacks could also be in the form of unnecessary requests for routes, very frequent generation of beacon packets, or forwarding of stale packets to other nodes. The acknowledgment spoofing attack is launched on routing algorithms that require transmission of acknowledgment packets. An attacking node may overhear packet transmissions from its neighboring nodes and spoof the acknowledgments, thereby providing false information to the nodes BIB003 . In this way, the attacker is able to disseminate wrong information in the network about the status of the nodes, since acknowledgments may arrive from nodes that are not alive in reality. In addition to the aforementioned categories of attacks, various other types of attacks are possible on the routing protocols in WSNs. Most of the routing protocols in WSNs are vulnerable to attacks such as routing table overflows, routing table poisoning, packet replication, route cache poisoning, and rushing attacks. A comprehensive discussion on these attacks may be found in BIB004"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

A molecular basis for the pathogenesis of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. Genetic evidence suggests that mutations in the gamma (c) receptor subunit cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). The gamma (c) subunit can be employed in receptor complexes for IL-2,-4,-7,-9, and-15, and the multiple signaling defects that would result from a defective gamma (c) chain in these receptors are proposed to cause the severe phenotype of X-SCID patients. Interestingly, gene disruption of either IL-7 or the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) alpha subunit in mice leads to immunological defects that are similar to human X-SCID. These observations suggest the functional importance of gamma (c) in the IL-7R complex. In the present study, structure / function analyses of the IL-7R complex using a chimeric receptor system demonstrated that gamma (c) is indeed critical for IL-7R function. Nonetheless, only a limited portion of the cytoplasmic domain of gamma (c) is necessary for IL-7R signal transduction. Furthermore, replacement of the gamma (c) cytoplasmic domain by a severely truncated erythropoeitin receptor does not affect measured IL-7R signaling events. These findings support a model in which gamma (c) serves primarily to activate signal transduction by the IL-7R complex, while IL-7R alpha determines specific signaling events through its association with cytoplasmic signaling molecules. Finally, these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the molecular pathogenesis of X-SCID is due primarily to gamma (c) -mediated defects in the IL-7 / IL-7R system","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"cytoplasmic domain\\", \\"IL - 7R complex\\", \\"gamma (c) receptor subunit\\", \\"gamma (c) chain\\", \\"receptor complexes\\", \\"IL - 7 receptor (IL - 7R) alpha subunit\\", \\"chimeric receptor\\", \\"gamma (c) subunit\\", \\"IL - 2 , - 4 , - 7 , - 9 , and - 15\\", \\"IL - 7R\\", \\"/ IL - 7R\\", \\"human interleukin - 7 receptor complex\\", \\"severely truncated erythropoeitin receptor\\", \\"IL - 7R alpha\\", \\"IL - 7\\", \\"cytoplasmic signaling molecules\\", \\"gamma (c)\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Recent studies have found direct associations between specific SNPs and breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Our aim was to determine whether validated susceptibility SNP scores improve the predictive ability of risk models in comparison/conjunction to other clinical/demographic information.(METHODS) Female BRCA1/2 carriers were identified from the Manchester genetic database, and included in the study regardless of breast cancer status or age. DNA was extracted from blood samples provided by these women and used for gene and SNP profiling. Estimates of survival were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit in the separate BRCA datasets and in menopausal stages screening different combinations of clinical/demographic/genetic variables. Nonlinear random survival forests were also fit to identify relevant interactions. Models were compared using Harrell's concordance index (1 - c-index).(RESULTS) 548 female BRCA1 mutation carriers and 523 BRCA2 carriers were identified from the database. Median Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 46.0 years (44.9-48.1) for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2.

Although demotivating weaknesses may lead to repeated day-to-day stress with a cascade of deleterious consequences at both personal and professional levels, a possible relationship between these parameters has not been reported. This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between students ' perceptions of their educational environment and their stress levels. Sixty-one first year students at the Dental Faculty, University of Malaya, Malaysia participated. The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) was used to determine educational environment while self-rated perceived stress level was measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Most students (62.39%) showed positive perceptions for the total and five domains of DREEM. The highest percentage was observed for \\" Students perception of learning \\" (64.04%) while the lowest was for \\" Students ' social self- perception \\" (60.32%). At the same time, 61% of students showed high perceived stress levels. However, this was not associated with their DREEM scores. Although a positive perception of their educational environment was found, minor corrective measures need to be implemented. Furthermore, longitudinal studies on an annual basis would provide useful input for strategic planning purposes.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"perception\\", \\"practice\\", \\"Perceived\\", \\"stress\\", \\"perceptions\\", \\"learning\\", \\"Experience\\", \\"perceived\\", \\"Stress\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"parameters\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"DREEM\\", \\"Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure\\", \\"self-rated\\", \\"DASS\\", \\"Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [\\"University of Malaya\\"], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"Dental Faculty\\", \\"Students\\", \\"Dental Students\\", \\"students\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"longitudinal studies\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"Malaysia\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

The codehas been slightly simplified. Our modeldetects correctly that the variable used in the highlighted (yellow) slot is incorrect. Instead,first should have been placed at the slot. We reportedthis problem which was fixed in PR 4138. apart in thesource file. Secondly, weintroduce the variable misuse prediction task (VARMISUSE), in which the network aims to infer which variable should be used in a program location. To illustratethe task, Figure 1 shows a slightly simplified snippet of a bug our model detected in a popular open-source project. Specifically,instead of the variable clazz, variable first should have been used in the yellow highlighted slot. Existing staticanalysis methods cannot detect such issues, even though a software engineer would easily identify this as an error from experience.To achieve high accuracy on these tasks, we need to learn representations of program semantics. For both tasks,we need to learn the semantic role of a variable (e.g., \\"is it a counter?\\", \\"is it a filename?\\"). Additionally, forVARMISUSE, learning variable usage semantics (e.g., \\"a filename is needed here\\") is required. This \\"fill the blankelement\\" task is related to methods for learning distributed representations of natural language words, such as Word2Vec BID20 and GLoVe BID21 . However, we can learnfrom a much richer structure such as data flow information. This work is a step towardslearning program representations, and we expect them to be valuable in a wide range of other tasks, such as code completion (\\"this is the variable you are looking for\\") and more advanced bug finding (\\"you should lock before using this object\\").To summarize, our contributionsare: (i) We define the VARMISUSE taskas a challenge for machine learning modeling of source code, that requires to learn (some) semantics of programs (cf. section 3).(ii) We present deep learning modelsfor solving the VARNAMING and VARMISUSE tasks by modeling the code's graph structure and learning program representations over those graphs (cf. section 4). (iii) We evaluate our models on a largedataset of 2.9 million lines of real-world source code, showing that our best model achieves 32.9% accuracy on the VARNAMING task and 85.5% accuracy on the VARMISUSE task, beating simpler baselines (cf. section 5). (iv) We document practical relevance ofVARMISUSE by summarizing some bugs that we found in mature open-source software projects (cf. subsection 5.3). Our implementation of graph neural networks(on a simpler task) can be found at https://github.com/Microsoft/gated-graph-neural-network-samples and the dataset can be found at https://aka.ms/iclr18-prog-graphs-dataset.Although source code is well understood and studied within other disciplines such as programming language research, it is a relatively new domain for deep learning.It presents novel opportunities compared to textual or perceptual data, as its (local) semantics are well-defined and rich additional information can be extracted using well-known, efficient program analyses.On the other hand, integrating this wealth of structured information poses an interesting challenge.Our VARMISUSE task exposes these opportunities, going beyond simpler tasks such as code completion.We consider it as a first proxy for the core challenge of learning the meaning of source code, as it requires to probabilistically refine standard information included in type systems.A PERFORMANCE CURVES FIG4 shows the ROC and precision-recall curves for the GGNN model.As the reader may observe, setting a false positive rate to 10% we get a true positive rate 5 of 73% for the SEENPROJTEST and 69% for the unseen test.This suggests that this model can be practically used at a high precision setting with acceptable performance.","answer":"Programs have structure that can be represented as graphs, and graph neural networks can learn to find bugs on such graphs"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A carboxy-terminally truncated but functionally active C6. Individuals with subtotal complement C6 deficiency possess a C6 molecule that is 14% shorter than normal C6 and present in low but detectable concentrations (1-2% of the normal mean). We now show that this dysmorphic C6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the pUEX expression system. We thus predicted that the abnormal C6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14% from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence. By sequencing PCR-amplified products from this region, we found, in three individuals from two families, a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the defect. All three have an abnormal 5 splice donor site of intron 15, which would probably prevent splicing. An in-frame stop codon is found 17 codons downstream from the intron boundary, which would lead to a truncated polypeptide 13. 5% smaller than normal C6. This result was unexpected, as earlier studies mapped the C5b binding site, or a putative enzymatic region, to this part of C6. Interestingly, all three subjects were probably heterozygous for both subtotal C6 and complete C6 deficiency.","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"subtotal complement C6 deficiency\\", \\"subtotal C6 and complete C6 deficiency\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother did subsequently develop antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection [46] . Her exposure history to a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive relative and an antibody-reactive husband, her incubation period and her symptom history met the WHO criteria for being a probable MERS-CoV case [46] . Diagnostic methods were published within days of the ProMED email announcing the first MERS case [47] , including several now gold standard in-house RT-rtPCR assays (Fig. 2 ) as well as virus culture in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells [18, 47, 48] . A colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) epithelial cell line has since been recommended for isolation of infections MERS-CoV [49] . We previously [18] . ). Open reading frames are indicated as yellow rectangles bracketed by terminal untranslated regions (UTR; grey rectangles). FS-frame-shift. Predicted regions encompassing recombination break-points are indicated by orange pills. Created using Geneious v8.1 [211] and annotated using Adobe Illustrator. Beneath this is a schematic depicting the location of RT-PCR primers (blue arrows indicate direction) and oligoprobes (green rectangles) used in the earliest RT-rtPCR screening assays and conventional, semi-nested (three primers) RT-PCR confirmatory sequencing assays [47, 48] . Publication order is noted by first [27 th September 2012; red] and second [6 th December 2012; orange] coloured rectangles; both from Corman et al. [47, 48] Those assays recommended by the WHO are highlighted underneath by yellow dots [53] . The NSeq reverse primer has consistently contained one sequence mismatch with some MERS-CoV variants. An altered version of that from Mackay IM, Arden KE. Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd. Virus Res 2015 Vol 202:60-88 with permission from Elsevier [5] reviewed the broad tropism of MERS-CoV [5] . However, as is well described, cell culture is a slow, specialised and insensitive method [50] while PCR-based techniques are the preferred method for MERS-CoV detection. The first open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b; Fig. 2 ) have become a key diagnostic and taxonomic target for CoV species identification. With less than 80 % identity between the amino acid sequence of MERS ORF 1ab and betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, it can be concluded that it is a novel and distinct virus. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode ten open reading frames with 5' and 3' untranslated regions [51] . The structural proteins include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [52] . The products of ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode nonstructural proteins. The majority of specimen testing to date has employed validated RT-rtPCR assays shown to be sensitive and specific [47, 48, 53] . The RealStar® kit uses these WHOrecommended assays [54] . The target sequences of these screening assays have not changed among genomes examined until at least mid-2015 (IMM observation). Other RT-rtPCR assays have been developed and validated for use as laboratory-based diagnostic tools [55] [56] [57] . Additionally, loop-mediated [58, 59] or recombinase polymerase [60] isothermal assays have been designed for field deployment. The detection of MERS-CoV antigen has not been common to date but the combination of short turnaround time from test to result, high throughput and identification of viral proteins makes this an attractive option. Detection of viral proteins rather than viral RNA indicates the likely presence of infectious virus. The first rapid immunochromatographic tool described could detect recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein from DC nasal swabs with 94 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity compared to RT-rtPCR [61] . A different approach used a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein with a sensitivity of 10 3 TCID 50 and 100 % specificity [62] . Demonstration of a seroconversion to a MERS-CoV infection meets the current WHO definition of a case so optimized and thoroughly validated sero-assays employed alongside good clinical histories are useful to both identify prior MERS-CoV infection and help support transmission studies. Because serology testing is, by its nature, retrospective, it is usual to detect a viral footprint, in the form of antibodies, in the absence of any signs or symptoms of disease and often in the absence of any viral RNA [63] . Strategic, widespread sero-surveys of humans using samples collected after 2012 are infrequent. Much of the Arabian Peninsula and all of the Horn of Africa lack baseline data describing the proportion of the community who may have been infected by a MERS-CoV. However, sero-surveys have had widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a transmission source for MERS-CoV. Because of the identity shared between DC and human MERS-CoV (see Molecular epidemiology: using genomes to understand outbreaks), serological assays for DC sero-surveys should be transferrable to human screening with minimal re-configuration. Also, no diagnostically relevant variation in neutralization activity have been found from among a range of circulating tested MERS-CoV isolates and sera, so whole virus or specific protein-based sero-assays should perform equivalently in detecting serological responses to the single MERS-CoV serotype [49] . The development of robust serological assays requires reliable panels of wellcharacterized animal or human sera, including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to likely sources of cross-reaction [64] . Obtaining these materials was problematic and slowed the development and commercialization of antibody detection assays for human testing [64] . A number of commercial ELISA kits, immunofluorescent assays (IFA) kits, recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies have been released [31, [65] [66] [67] [68] . Initially, conventional IFAs were used for human sero-surveys. These relied on MERS-CoV-infected cell culture as an antigen source, detecting the presence of human anti-MERS-CoV IgG, IgM or neutralizing antibodies in human samples [18, 48, 69] . No sign of MERS-CoV antibodies was found among 2,400 sera from patients visiting Hospital in Jeddah, from 2010 through 2012, prior to the description of MERS-CoV [18] . Nor did IFA methods detect any sign of prior MERS-CoV infection among a small sample of 130 healthy blood donors from another Hospital in Jeddah (collected between Jan and Dec 2012) [70] . Of 226 slaughterhouse workers, only eight (3.5 %) were positive by IFA, and those sera could not be confirmed by virus neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of crossreactive antigen in the whole virus IFA [70] . Whole virus MERS-CoV IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera and this could not be resolved by an NT test which was also cross-reactive [71] . IFA using recombinant proteins instead of whole-virus IFA, has been shown to be a more specific tool [31] . Since asymptomatic zoonoses have been posited [72] , an absence of antibodies to MERS-CoV among some humans who have regular and close contact with camels may reflect the rarity of actively infected animals at butcheries, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs [70] , a pre-existing cross-protective immune status or some other factor(s) resulting in a low risk of disease and concurrent seroconversion developing after exposure in this group. IFA using recombinant proteins instead. Some sero-assays have bypassed the risks of working with infectious virus by creating transfected cells expressing recombinant portions of the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid and spike proteins [48, 73] , or using a recombinant lentivirus expressing MERS-CoV spike protein and luciferase [74, 75] . A pseudo particle neutralization (ppNT) assay has seen widespread used in animal studies and was at least as sensitive as the traditional microneutralization (MNT) test. [10, 74, [76] [77] [78] ] Studies using small sample numbers and ppNT found no evidence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody in sera from 158 children with LRT infections between May 2010 and May 2011, 110 sera from 19 to 52 year old male blood donors and 300 selfidentified animal workers from the Jazan Region of the KSA during 2012 [79, 80] . Similarly, a study of four herdsmen in contact with an infected DC herd in Al-Ahsa, eight people who had intermittent contact with the herd, 30 veterinary surgeons and support staff who were not exposed to the herd, three unprotected abattoir workers in Al-Ahsa and 146 controls who were not exposed to DCs in any professional role, found none with serological evidence of past MERS-CoV infection using the ppNT assay [10] . A delay in the neutralizing antibody response to MERS-CoV infection was associated with increased disease severity in South Korea cases with most responses detectable by week three of illness while others, even though disease was severe, did not respond for four or more weeks [81] . The implications for our ability to detect any response in mild or asymptomatic cases was not explored but may be a signifcant factor in understanding exposure in the wider community. A Jordanian outbreak of acute LRT disease in a hospital in 2012 was retrospectively found to be associated with MERS-CoV infection, initially using RT-rtPCR, but subsequently, and on a larger scale, through positivity by ELISA and IFA or MNT test. [46, 82, 83] This outbreak predated the first case of MERS in the KSA. The ELISA used a recombinant nucleocapsid protein from the group 2 betacoronavirus bat-CoV HKU5 to identify antibodies against the equivalent crossreactive MERS-CoV protein [71] . It was validated using 545 sera collected from people with prior HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HRV, HMPV or influenza A(H1N1) infections but was reportedly less specific than the recombinant IFA discussed above. It was still considered an applicable tool for screening large sample numbers [82] . A protein microarray expressing the S1 protein subunit has also been validated and widely used for DC testing [5, 84] . Detection of MERS-CoV infection using ELISA or S1 subunit protein microarray [84] is usually followed by confirmatory IFA and/ or a plaque-reduction neutralization (PRNT) [69, 70, 85] or MNT test. [74, 85, 86] This confirmatory process aims toensure the antibodies detected are able to specifically neutralize the intended virus and are not more broadly reactive to other coronaviruses found in DCs (bovine CoV, BCoV) or humans (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV). In the largest study of human sera, a tiered diagnostic process assigned both recombinant IFA and recombinant ELISA positive sera to 'stage 1' seropositivity. A stage 2 seropositive result additionally required a suitably titred PRNT result [87] . The study found 15 sera collected in 2012 to 2013 from 10,009 (0.2 %) people in 13 KSA provinces contained MERS-CoV antibodies, but significantly higher proportions in occurred in camel shepherds (two of 87; 2.3 %) and slaughterhouse workers (five of 140; 3.6 %) [87] . Contemporary surveys are needed. MERS-CoV does not appear to be easily transmitted from DCs to humans, or perhaps it is [72] , but generally does not trigger a detectable immune response if only mild disease or asymptomatic infection results. Serology assays are in need of further validation in this area so care is required when moving newly developed diagnostic serology algorithms from a research setting to one that informs public health decisions. This was reinforced when a false positive US case, purported to have been infected after a handshake and two face-to-face meetings, did not withstand further confirmatory analysis using a more specific, NT assay and was subsequently retracted [88, 89] . The WHO recommends sampling from the LRT for MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR testing, especially when sample collection is delayed by a week or more after onset of symptoms. [53] LRT samples are also best for attempting isolation of infectious virus, although the success of culture is reduced when disease persists [49] . Recommended sample types include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal/tracheobronchial aspirate, pleural fluid and sputum [53, 90] . Fresh samples yield better diagnostic results than refrigerated material [69] and if delays in testing of ≥72 h are likely, samples (except for blood) should be frozen at −70°C [90] . If available, lung biopsy or autopsy tissues can also be tested [53] . The URT is a less invasive and more convenient sampling site however, and an oropharyngeal and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash are recommended when URT sampling is to be conducted [90] . Paired sera, collected two to three weeks apart are preferable for serological testing while a single sample is suggested to be sufficient if collected two weeks after onset of disease or a single serum collected during the first 10-12 days if conducting RT-rtPCR [53, 90] .

Eight women and five men suffering from cancer and with a life expectancy of 3 months or less were interviewed . In each case one of the family members was also interviewed . Four patients spent their last phase of life at home , nine in a hospice . This paper provides further insight in the patient perspective in palliative care . The results reveal that a cohabiting partner seems an important prerequisite for  terminally ill patients to stay at home . For spouses it is an obvious choice to facilitate the patients ' stay at home , even when it becomes too dem and ing , something not discussed between spouse and patient . When sufficient care at home seems impossible and the negotiation between patients and family members results in the opinion that living at home is no longer an option , it is decided that the patient moves to a hospice . The choice for the specific setting of the patients ' new residence seems to be r and om ; one possibility is pointed out to them and seems appropriateTitle 2:Dignity Through Integrated Symptom Management: Lessons From the Breathlessness Support Service.Abstract 2:CONTEXT Dignity is poorly conceptualized and little empirically explored in end-of-life care .

sided constricting chest pain with excessive sweating for 1 hour duration . on examination, he was anxious with a pulse rate of 108/min , regular in rhythm blood pressure ( bp ) of 120/80 mmhg and respiratory rate of 16/min .electrocardiogram was suggestive of anterior wall myocardial infarction , with st elevation in v1v4 and st depression in leads 1 and avl .his chest pain subsided , and electrocardiogram taken 90 minutes after thrombolysis showed good st resolution .his oxygen saturation in room air fell to 86% from an initial value of 99% .his jugular venous pressure was normal , and there were no signs of heart failure . a chest x - ray ( figure 1 ) revealed bilateral alveolar infiltrates .high - resolution computed tomography ( hrct ) of thorax ( figure 2 ) confirmed the presence of alveolar hemorrhage .after 1 week , his oxygen saturation in room air was 98% and his lung fields were normal on auscultation . a chest x - ray taken after 10 days showed resolution of lesions ( figure 3 ) .the tests for anti - glomerular basement membrane antibodies , antinuclear antibodies , anti - double - stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies , peripheral anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( p - ancas ) and cytoplasmic ancas showed negative results .toxicology screening and retroviral screening were negative . on follow - up after 1 month , pulmonary function tests , including diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide , were done , which were reported as normal .thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction can result in hemorrhagic complications , the most common being bleeding from vascular access sites .pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage is an uncommon and life - threatening complication of fibrinolytic therapy and should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of pulmonary infiltrates or a decreasing level of hemoglobin after thrombolysis.1,2 there are no data regarding the exact incidence of this complication , except for a few case reports .some predisposing factors include immunodeficiency , pneumonia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , congestive heart failure and cocaine and tobacco abuse .pathogenesis of alveolar hemorrhage following thrombolysis is incompletely understood , and the exact mechanism is not yet elucidated.3,4 other causes of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage include acute respiratory distress syndrome , pulmonary renal syndrome , idiopathic pulmonary capillaritis and connective tissue diseases.5 ikeda et al6 reported a case in which alveolar hemorrhage occurred following dual anti - platelet therapy .clinically , pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage presents as a triad of hemoptysis , diffuse alveolar opacities in chest radiography and anemia .many cases do not exhibit this classical triad , but alveolar hemorrhage should be suspected when at least two of them are present .hemoptysis may not be evident in a few cases , because of the distal location of the bleeding source.7 dyspnea results from both ventilation / perfusion mismatch secondary to alveolar filling and anemia .rarely , there may be consolidation with air bronchogram or multiple nodules reflecting acinar filling .hrct shows ground - glass opacities or consolidation , with predominantly central involvement and relative sparing of the lung periphery.8 at a later stage , alveolar opacities are replaced by more reticular opacities and micronodules , reflecting hemorrhage resorption in the pulmonary interstitium .an increase in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide is attributed to increased carbon monoxide uptake by intra - alveolar red blood cells . a macroscopically hemorrhagic bronchoalveolar lavage( bal ) fluid is considered diagnostic of acute alveolar hemorrhage.9 after a bleeding episode , hemoglobin is converted into hemosiderin by alveolar macrophages in 3672 hours .hemosiderin - laden macrophages reside in the lungs for 48 weeks.10 management consists of treatment of respiratory failure with supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation , if needed .instances with severe anemia due to rapid decline in hemoglobin should be corrected with packed cell transfusion.11 written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this report and accompanying images .written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this report and accompanying images .","answer":"we report a case of a 58-year -

P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.(RESULTS) The study included 1772 female and 289 male patients. The mean age for male patients was 44.07 ± 11.91 years compared to 41.29 ± 12.18 years for female patients (P = 0.706). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully completed in 1996 patients. The conversion rate was higher in men (P < 0.001), and the mean operating time was longer in men (P < 0.001). Bile duct injuries occurred more frequently in men (P < 0.001). Gallbladder perforation and gallstone spillage also occurred more commonly in men (P = 0.001); similarly severe inflammation was reported more in male patients (P = 0001). There were no statistically significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection and port-site herniation between men and women. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy (odds ratio = 2.65, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-6.94, P = 0.041) and biliary injuries (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.99, P-value = 0.036).Question:Does sex affect the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Although mouse models are widely employed in preclinical studies, few urinary biomarker studies have been performed in mice due to limited urine availability and lack of sensitive assays. Here, we report the development and validation of two different assays for quantitative assessment of mouse urinary KIM-1 (uKIM-1) and compare the sensitivity of KIM-1 relative to other standard markers in ischemia reperfusion and aristolochic acid (AA)-induced kidney injury in mice. A sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative microbead-based KIM-1 ELISA was established, which requires only 10 μl urine for triplicate determination with an assay range of 12.21 pg/ml to 50 ng/ml. The second assay is a laminar flow dipstick assay, which has an assay range of 195 pg/ml to 50 ng/ml and provides quantitative assessment of KIM-1 in 15 min. uKIM-1 levels increased with increasing time of ischemia or time after AA administration. After only 10-min ischemia followed by 24-h reperfusion, uKIM-1 was significantly elevated by 13-fold, whereas serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAG), and proteinuria levels did not change. After AA administration, uKIM-1 levels were significantly upregulated by greater than threefold within 12 h, whereas sCr and NAG levels were unchanged. Mouse KIM-1 was stable for multiple freeze-thaw cycles, for up to 5 days at room temperature and up to at least an year when stored at -80°C.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"N-acetyl\\", \\"creatinine\\", \\"urea\\", \\"aristolochic acid\\", \\"nitrogen\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"uKIM-1\\", \\"NAG\\", \\"Mouse KIM-1\\", \\"Kidney injury molecule-1\\", \\"N-acetyl-u03b2-glucosaminidase\\", \\"KIM-1\\", \\"mouse urinary KIM-1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The result is a powerful image representationtrainable end-to-end on the target task (in our case place recognition).To construct a layer amenable to training via backpropagation,it is required that the layer’s operation is differentiable withrespect to all its parameters and the input.Hence, the key challenge is to make the VLAD pooling differentiable, which we describe next. By expanding the squares in (2), it is easy to see that the terme^{-alphalVertmathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i}rVert^{2}} cancels between the numerator and the denominatorresulting in a soft-assignment of the following formbar{a}_{k}(mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i})=frac{e^{mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k}^{T}mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i}+b_{k}}}{sum_{k^{prime}}{e^{mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k^{prime}}^{T}mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i}+b_{k^{prime}}}}},(3)where vector mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k}=2alphamathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf c}}_{k} and scalar b_{k}=-alphalVertmathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf c}}_{k}rVert^{2}.The final form of the NetVLAD layer is obtained byplugging the soft-assignment (3) into the VLAD descriptor (1) resulting inV(j,k)=sum_{i=1}^{N}frac{e^{mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k}^{T}mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i}+b_{k}}}{sum_{k^{prime}}{e^{mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k^{prime}}^{T}mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i}+b_{k^{prime}}}}}left(x_{i}(j)-c_{k}(j)right),(4)where{mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k}}, {b_{k}} and {mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf c}}_{k}} are sets of trainable parameters for each cluster k.Similarly to the original VLAD descriptor, the NetVLAD layer aggregates the first order statistics of residuals (mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i}-mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf c}}_{k})in different parts of the descriptor space weighted by the soft-assignment bar{a}_{k}(mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i}) of descriptor mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf x}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf x}}_{i} to cluster k.Note however, that the NetVLAD layer has three independentsets of parameters {mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k}}, {b_{k}} and {mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf c}}_{k}}, compared to just{mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf c}}_{k}} of the original VLAD. This enables greater flexibility than the original VLAD,as explained in figure 3.Decoupling {mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf w}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf w}}_{k},b_{k}} from {mathchoice{mbox{boldmathdisplaystylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathtextstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptstylebf c}}{mbox{boldmathscriptscriptstylebf c}}_{k}} has been proposed in[3] as a means to adapt the VLAD to a new dataset.All parameters of NetVLAD are learnt for the specific task in an end-to-end manner.Question: How does the NetVLAD layer differ from the original VLAD?","answer":"The original VLAD method uses hand-crafted features and applies the VLAD technique to them by concatenating multiple VLADs. On the other hand, NetVLAD layer uses a CNN to extract features and applies the VLAD technique in a single layer by learning the aggregation weights of the residuals (xi − ck) in different parts of the descriptor space. The NetVLAD layer has three independent sets of parameters, {wk}, {bk} and {ck}, that enables greater flexibility and adaptability to the CNN features than the original VLAD method which uses only {ck}."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We propose a distributed projected gradient method where each node, at each iteration @math , performs an update (is active) with probability @math , and stays idle (is inactive) with probability @math . Whenever active, each node performs an update by weight-averaging its solution estimate with the estimates of its active neighbors, taking a negative gradient step with respect to its local cost, and performing a projection onto the constraint set; inactive nodes perform no updates. Assuming that nodes' local costs are strongly convex, with Lipschitz continuous gradients, we show that, as long as activation probability @math grows to one asymptotically, our algorithm converges in the mean square sense (MSS) to the same solution as the standard distributed gradient method, i.e., as if all the nodes were active at all iterations. Moreover, when @math grows to one linearly, with an appropriately set convergence factor, the algorithm has a linear MSS convergence, with practically the same factor as the standard distributed gradient method. Simulations on both synthetic and real world data sets demonstrate that, when compared with the standard distributed gradient method, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the overall number of per-node communications and per-node gradient evaluations (computational cost) for the same required accuracy.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Many structured data-fitting applications require the solution of an optimization problem involving a sum over a potentially large number of measurements. Incremental gradient algorithms offer inexpensive iterations by sampling a subset of the terms in the sum; these methods can make great progress initially, but often slow as they approach a solution. In contrast, full-gradient methods achieve steady convergence at the expense of evaluating the full objective and gradient on each iteration. We explore hybrid methods that exhibit the benefits of both approaches. Rate-of-convergence analysis shows that by controlling the sample size in an incremental-gradient algorithm, it is possible to maintain the steady convergence rates of full-gradient methods. We detail a practical quasi-Newton implementation based on this approach. Numerical experiments illustrate its potential benefits.","answer":"Reference [1] is closest to our paper within this thread of works, and our work mainly draws inspiration from it. The authors consider a bounded sample size, as we do here. They consider both deterministic and stochastic sampling and determine the increase of the sample size along iterations such that the algorithm attains (almost) the same rate as if the full sample size was used at all iterations. A major difference of [1] with respect to the current paper is that they are not concerned with the networked scenario, i.e., therein a central entity works with the variable (increasing) sample size. This setup is very different from ours as it has no problem dimension of propagating information across the networked nodes -- the dimension present in distributed multi-agent optimization."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We studied whether the beneficial effects of growth hormone (GH) treatment on growth and body composition in PWS are accompanied by an improvement in respiratory function. We measured resting ventilation, airway occlusion pressure (P (0. 1)) and ventilatory response to CO (2) in nine children, aged 7-14 years, before and 6-9 months after the start of GH treatment. During GH treatment, resting ventilation increased by 26%, P (0. 1) by 72% and the response to CO (2) by 65% (P < 0. 002, < 0. 04 and < 0. 02, respectively). This observed increase in ventilatory output was not correlated to changes in body mass index. CONCLUSION  Treatment of children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) seems to have a stimulatory effect on central respiratory structures. The observed increase in ventilation and inspiratory drive may contribute to the improved activity level reported by parents of PWS children during growth hormone therapy","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"Prader-Willi syndrome\\", \\"PWS\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2017 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

[cols=\\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\\",options=\\"header \\" , ]      the mean pareto exponent @xmath13 over a four - year period for norway is @xmath15 for income and @xmath16 for wealth .note that the pareto exponent for income is significantly larger than the pareto exponent for wealth .this is the most reliable result thus far obtained for income and wealth analysis @xcite . in addition , the pareto exponents for income fluctuate in time more than pareto exponents for wealth .this means that wealth inequality is more difficult to change than income inequality .note that the results obtained thus far by authors not using data supplied by tax authorities are unsystematic and approximate .    using our comparative analysis we find that for separate regions in norway the pareto exponents for wealth are almost always smaller than the corresponding pareto exponents for income .this means that wealth inequality is higher than income inequality , i.e. , the lower the pareto exponent , the higher the inequality .this is because income has no accumulation effect across the generations that acts according to the preferential choice rule , \`\` the rich become richer . ''income inequality is strongly affected by access to skills and higher education and is lowered by taxes on income , but wealth accumulation is a long - term process and is less burdened by taxes , i.e. , a cadastral tax or inheritance tax does not significantly reduce wealth inequality ( see @xcite ) .although one possible solution to this situation would be to introduce an annual tax on wealth , social and political factors make this change difficult @xcite .    using high quality empirical data from the norwegian tax office , we have analyzed income and wealth of the richest norwegian individuals .we find that income and wealth inequality should be analyzed separately because they are driven by different factors @xcite .in addition , we confirm that the distribution of top income and wealth is subject to the pareto law .we are aware that the analysis of income and wealth is a research area for which much has yet to be accomplished .we hope that our paper contributes some insight into the topic from a physicist s point of view .the proposed approach is a link between economics and econophysics and shows that the economic models describing the relationship between income and wealth can be supported by modelling based on methods used by physicists .31ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo \`\` \`\` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] + 1212  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop __  ( ,  ,  ) @noop _ _  ( ,  ) in  @noop _ _ ,  ( ,  ,  )  pp .@noop ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop ( ) ,   @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop _ _  ( ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) in @noop _ _ ,  ( ,  ,  )  pp .   in  @noop _ _ ,  ( ,  ,  )  pp . @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop \`\` , ''   ( ) ,   @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop \`\` , ''   ( ) ,   @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )","answer":"using the empirical data from the norwegian tax office , we analyse the wealth and income of the richest individuals in norway during the period 20102013 .  we find that both annual income and wealth level of the richest individuals are describable using the pareto law .  we find that the robust mean pareto exponent over the four - year period to be @xmath0 for income and @xmath1 for wealth .     income distribution , pareto law , income and wealth inequalities"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Text: Influenza like-illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infections can be caused by several types of respiratory viruses or bacteria in humans [1] . Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial viruses (RSV) and Parainfluenza viruses  are identified as major viruses mostly responsible for ILI and pneumonia in several studies [2] . However practitioners cannot diagnose the infection without a biological test confirmation. Unfortunately, these infections causes are identified in less than 50% [3] . Réunion Island, a French overseas territory with 850,000 inhabitants, is located in the southern hemisphere between Madagascar and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean (Latitude: 21°05.2920 S Longitude: 55°36.4380 E.). The island benefits from a healthcare system similar to mainland France and epidemiological surveillance has been developed by the regional office of the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Cire OI), based on the surveillance system of mainland France [4] . Influenza activity generally increases during austral winter, corresponding to summer in Europe [5] . Since 2011, influenza vaccination campaign in Reunion Island starts in April and the vaccine used corresponds to World Health Organization recommendations for the southern hemisphere. Since 1996, clinical and biological influenza surveillance has been based on a sentinel practitioner's network [6] . In 2014, this network was composed of 58 general practitioners (GPs) spread over the island and represented around 7% of all Réunion Island GPs. Nasal swabs are randomly collected all along the year and are tested by RT-PCR for influenza viruses. Among these surveillance samples, 40 to 50% are tested positive for influenza A virus, A(H1N1)pdm09 or B virus by the virological laboratory of the University Hospital Center of Réunion. Thus ILI samples tested negative for influenza are of unknown etiology. Several biological tools allow identifying respiratory pathogens from nasal swab. In recent years, multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been developed to identify several viruses simultaneously [7] [8] [9] [10] . We therefore used this new method to set up a retrospective study using swabs collected by sentinel GPs from 2011 to 2012. The main objective of our study was to characterize respiratory pathogens responsible for ILI consultations in sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. Secondary objectives were to highlight seasonal trends on respiratory pathogens circulation and to describe occurrence of co-infections, especially during the flu season. ILI was defined as a sudden onset of fever more than 38 degrees Celsius and cough, associated or not with other symptoms such as breathing difficulty, headache, etc. Every week, all GPs of the sentinel network were encouraged to collect a nasal swab from the first two patients who presented ILI since less than three days. After being tested for influenza viruses, the 994 swabs collected in 2011 and 2012 are frozen at -80°C at the university hospital center (CHU) laboratory. Based on the budget, a season-stratified sample of 250 swabs was randomly selected in order to describe circulating viruses including outside flu season. Random sampling was performed with Excel 1 using the anonymized surveillance database of the Cire OI. The sampling frame contained identification number of swab assigned by Cire OI, laboratory identification number, sex, age, date of onset of symptoms, date of swab collection and result of influenza RT-PCR. We used Respifinder 1 Smart 22 kits a multiplex RT-PCR (PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands) which can detect 22 respiratory pathogens. This assay is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. The reverse transcription and preamplification steps were performed on the epgradient Mastercycler 1 (Eppendorf) and the hybridization, ligation and detection steps on the LightCycler 1 480 system (Roche Applied Science). This method was chosen because of its high specificity, compared to other same methods (78% versus 33%) [3, 11] . Multiplex analysis allows for rapid production of diagnostic results. It thus allows highlighted the possible presence of eighteen respiratory viruses and four bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis: Influenza A not (H1N1 Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 1 and Excel 1 . Two seasons were defined to identify possible seasonal trends in circulation of the viruses: winter season during weeks 23 to 39 between June and September and summer season during the rest of the year. Data and swabs result from a surveillance system that received regulatory approvals, including the CNIL (National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties Number 1592205) approval in July 2012. All the patients have received oral information and gave their consent for swab and data collection. Data were collected for surveillance purpose and are totally anonymous. Among the 250 randomly-selected swabs, 26 were not available anymore as they were sent to Influenza Reference Center for confirmation and characterization of the pathogenic agent. According to the sensitivity of the assay two samples could be discordant results between Influenza PCR initially realized and Multiplex PCR. Thus they were deleted from the analysis: one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and negative for all tested pathogens in multiplex and one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and positive for PIV2 in multiplex. In total, 222 analyses were considered. Moreover, 53 samples were negative for all analyzed respiratory pathogens (23.9%) and 169 samples had at least one detected pathogen (76.1%), finally a total of 178 pathogens was identified. During the study period, a minority of the weeks (21 i.e. 20%) did not include any sampled swab, mainly outside flu season. Patients' sex-ratio was 0.63 (86 men and 136 women) and mean age was 28.4 years [min 0; max 81]. Ten percent had less than 5 years, 24% 5-15 years, 63% 15-65 years and only 3% were 65 and older. The respiratory pathogens most frequently identified in ILI swabs were rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A not H1N1 (21.2%) and influenza B (12.6%) ( Table 1) . Among the 22 respiratory pathogens tested by the multiplex, only three were not found in any analyzed sample: Parainfluenza3, Legionella pneumophila and Bordetella pertussis. Regarding co-infections, nine swabs revealed the presence of two viruses, among which6 involved influenza viruses (Table 2) . Analyses showed that some viruses are possibly seasonal and were circulating during a specific period of the year. They are detected only in summer for Human Metapneumovirus, RSV A and B, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. For the latter, it is specific to the studied period since the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus reappeared in Réunion Island in October 2012 and was no longer circulating since late 2010. On the opposite, Parainfluenza 1,2 and 4 viruses were identified only in winter. For other pathogens, no specific period of detection was observed. A weekly description of samples was realized to study the distribution of respiratory pathogens in 2011 and 2012 (Fig 1) . Results of biological analyses were compared with data of ILI consultations declared by sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. We observed in 2011, after a first wave in June mainly due to influenza A not H1N1 virus, a second wave of ILI consultations with mainly identification of Parainfluenza viruses and not influenza viruses. In 2012, the second epidemic wave at the end of austral winter coincided with Influenza viruses and Rhinovirus circulation. Regarding negative swabs (Fig 2) , we observed no seasonality during the study period with a similar proportion whatever the season. This retrospective study based on a sentinel GPs network showed that not only influenza viruses are responsible for ILI consultations. Indeed, an important circulation of multiple pathogens was observed throughout the year, with 12 different types of pathogens identified in 2011 and 2012. Respiratory viral pathogens were present in 76.1% of samples, which is largely above results from annual influenza surveillance [12] . After influenza viruses, Rhinovirus and Coronavirus were the most common respiratory viruses in Réunion Island. Although samples were not taken every week, sample was representative of ILI activity and consistent with flu season. Nevertheless, according to the low number of samples, it is difficult to conclude about seasonality. However in our study, RSV was circulating in summer season which is hot and rainy, which is confirmed by other studies in tropical region [13] . This study also highlighted several co-infections, showing that concomitant the multiple etiology of ILI. Co-circulation was already observed in Réunion Island during the A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic in addition to influenza virus, with identification of other respiratory viruses such as Rhinovirus or Coronavirus [14] . In mainland France, during this pandemic, circulation of major respiratory viruses was found, such as Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus, Human Metapneumovirus, like in our publication [15] [16] . In our study, only 5.3% of positive swabs were co-infections whereas in two studies in Madagascar co-infections represented 27.3% and 29.4% [17] [18] . Despite the distance of 9,300 km between Réunion and France, the island is directly connected to Europe with four daily flights to France. These exchanges can impact respiratory pathogens circulation in southern and northern hemisphere. Results of this study can therefore be of interest to both Indian Ocean and Europe countries. Among the 148 swabs initially negative for influenza because not previously tested for any other viruses, the study found an etiology for 95 swabs. In total, only 53 swabs, representing 24% of the sample, remained without etiology with negative multiplex PCR results all along the year. Multiple hypotheses can explain this result: a poor quality of swabs, preventing from identifying a pathogen, noninfectious causes or other pathogens not included in the multiplex PCR. However, we couldn't test the negative swabs for RNAse P, a marker of human cells, which could provide a modicum of assurance that the swab contained human cells. Concerning the two samples divergent for influenza identification between the multiplex and singleplex PCR, we discarded them for the analysis; one was positive in Influenza with singleplex and positive in PIV with multiplex. It could be a false positive result from singleplex. Indeed, as the multiplex PCR assay has a good sensitivity and is considered as a gold-standard, we decided to keep seven negative results for Influenza in singleplex and positive in Influenza in multiplex [7] [8] [9] [10] . No case of Bordetella pertussis which causes whooping cough and Legionella pneumophila which causes Legionnaires' disease was identified in this study. However, these diseases are rare in Réunion Island, around three cases of Legionnaires' disease are declared each year. A limit of the study is that no clinical data were available in the virological surveillance system of influenza in Réunion Island. It was impossible to compare clinical symptoms according to each pathogen and to know if there are different pathogens which cause for instance rhinitis, laryngitis or bronchitis (diseases included in ILI). A specific prospective study including clinical data might provide useful elements in the semiotics of diseases. In conclusion, this study highlighted an important circulation of multiple pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI is not specific to influenza and so it is essential to have biological results in order to establish the differential diagnosis and thus explain the etiology of symptoms. For a better understanding of respiratory pathogens circulating in Réunion Island, information from this study may also be useful to practitioners who see many patients in consultation with ILI. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy in the ILI surveillance and allowed to highlight the circulation of other viruses and bacterial causes of respiratory infections, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Moreover, it would be interesting to repeat this study every 3 or 5 years adding clinical data to monitor the evolution of respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island over time.Question: Which are identified  as major viruses mostly responsible for ILI and pneumonia in several studies?","answer":"Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial viruses (RSV) and Parainfluenza viruses"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics. Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect. It is characterized by encephalopathy, headaches, seizures, or neurological deficits. Here, we describe an eight-and-a-half-yr-old male renal transplant recipient with right BN. MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both myelitis and right brachial plexitis. Symptoms persisted for three months despite TAC dose reduction, administration of IVIG and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after TAC was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by everolimus.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"everolimus\\", \\"TAC\\", \\"tacrolimus\\", \\"methylprednisolone\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"myelitis\\", \\"brachial plexitis\\", \\"headaches\\", \\"seizures\\", \\"encephalopathy\\", \\"Neurotoxicity\\", \\"brachial neuritis\\", \\"neurological deficits\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Fiber-optic biosensors (FOBS) are optical fiber-derived devices which use optical field to measure biological species such as cells, proteins, and DNA. Because of their efficiency, accuracy, low cost, and convenience, FOBS are promising alternatives to traditional immunological methods for biomolecule measurements. Tapered fiber-optic biosensors (TFOBS) are a type of FOBS which rely on special geometries to expose the evanescent field to interact with samples. In order to amplify sensitivity and selectivity, TFOBS are often used with various optical transduction mechanisms such as changes in refractive index, absorption, fluorescence, and Surface Plasmon Resonance. In this review, the basic principles of TFOBS are summarized. Various common geometries for evanescent sensing and the influence of geometric parameters on optical principles are reviewed. Finally, a detailed account of the studies done to date for biomolecules detection using TFOBS will be provided. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The human body is also sensitive to small adjustments in pH and the ability to accurately determine minute changes is achievable through the accuracy and sensitivity of fiber optic sensing systems. Several researchers from the University of Oviedo in Gijón, Spain developed an optical sensing system that utilized two sensing fiber optic cables, an inexpensive photodiode and a biosensing element that consisted of mercurochrome (a pH indicator) fixed to a gel matrix. After an initial blue light excitation, the fluorescence emitted by the pH indicator was then able to be detected by the photodiode. The second fiber optic cable detected the intensity of the initial blue activating signal. The ratio of these two signals provided the pH. The results showed that with increasing pH, the fluorescence also increased, in a linear fashion. These experiments require new gel to be made each time the experiment is conducted due to decomposition of the dye and long-term stability of the results could be improved with a screen printing of the immediate results BIB002 . Although research into fluorescence as a signal indicator for use with fiber optic sensors is becoming more common, uses of this technology for pH indication is rarer. In another application, a two-fiber optic cable system (miniaturized to a total diameter of 0.4 mm) has been developed to sense the color change of a pH indicator dye. This system is specialized to be accurate to 0.01 pH units within the range of 7.0-7.4 which directly aligns with the normal blood pH for humans BIB001 . There are currently no developed FOBS systems to directly measure the pH of biological fluids, as this example was tested in a non-biologic fluid. A clinically relevant FOBS with the aim to detect pH accurately in biological fluids would have to be developed and tested in living human specimens. This kind of research endeavor is expensive, harder to obtain the proper permissions for and has a longer overall process. There are also advantages to developing a sensor outside of this realm and proving its effectiveness before introducing it to clinical testing and applications."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

rich side of the valley of stability . unlike the remaining 99% of the heavy elements beyond iron these isotopes can not be created by ( slow or rapid ) neutron captures @xcite , and their solar and isotopic abundances are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the respective @xmath6- and @xmath7-process nuclei @xcite .however , so far it seems to be impossible to reproduce the solar abundances of all @xmath0 isotopes by one single process . in current understandingseveral ( independently operating ) processes seem to contribute .the largest fraction of @xmath0 isotopes is created in the \`\` @xmath2 process '' by sequences of photodissociations and @xmath8 decays @xcite .this occurs in explosive o / ne burning during snii explosions and reproduces the solar abundances for the bulk of @xmath0 isotopes within a factor of @xmath93 @xcite .the sn shock wave induces temperatures of 2 - 3 gk in the outer ( c , ne , o ) layers , sufficient for triggering the required photodisintegrations .more massive stellar models ( m@xmath1020  m@xmath11 ) seem to reach the required temperatures for efficient photodisintegration already at the end of hydrostatic o / ne burning @xcite .the decrease in temperature after passage of the shock leads to a freeze - out via neutron captures and mainly @xmath8 decays , resulting in the typical @xmath0-process abundance pattern with maxima at @xmath12mo ( @xmath3=50 ) and @xmath13sm ( @xmath3=82 ) .however , the @xmath2 process scenario suffers from a strong underproduction of the most abundant @xmath0 isotopes , @xmath14mo and @xmath15ru , due to lack of seed nuclei with @xmath1690 . for these missing abundances , alternative processes and siteshave been proposed , either using strong neutrino fluxes in the deepest ejected layers of a snii ( @xmath17 process @xcite ) , or rapid proton - captures in proton - rich , hot matter accreted on the surface of a neutron star ( @xmath18 process @xcite ) .a few @xmath0 nuclides may also be produced by neutrino - induced reactions during the @xmath2-process .this \`\` @xmath19 process '' @xcite was additionally introduced because the @xmath2 process alone strongly underproduces the odd - odd isotopes @xmath20la and @xmath21ta .these two isotopes could be the result of excitation by neutrino scattering on pre - existing @xmath6-process seed nuclei , depending on the still uncertain underlying nuclear physics .modern , self - consistent studies of the @xmath2-process have problems to synthesize @xmath0 nuclei in the regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .it is not yet clear whether the observed underproductions are only due to a problem with astrophysical models or also with the nuclear physics input , i.e. the reaction rates used .thus , the reduction of uncertainties in nuclear data is strictly necessary for a consistent understanding of the @xmath0 process .experimental data can improve the situation in two ways , either by directly replacing predictions with measured cross sections in the relevant energy range or by testing the reliability of predictions at other energies when the relevant energy range is not experimentally accessible . in this contextwe have carried out @xmath0-process network calculations with a modified reaction library which uses the most recent experimental and semi - empirical @xmath1 cross sections from the \`\` karlsruhe astrophysical database of nucleosynthesis in stars '' project , kadonis v0.2 @xcite .this aims to be a step towards an improved reaction library for the @xmath0 process , containing more experimental data .however , it has to be kept in mind that the largest fraction of the @xmath0-process network contains proton - rich , unstable isotopes which are not accessible for cross section measurements with present experimental techniques .hence there is no alternative to employing theoretical predictions for a large number of reactions .typically , these come from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations @xcite performed with the codes non - smoker @xcite or most @xcite .we studied the @xmath0 process in its manifestation as a @xmath2 process .the network calculations were carried out with the program \`\` pprosim '' @xcite .the underlying network was originally based on a reaction library from michigan state university for x - ray bursts which included only proton - rich isotopes up to xenon . for @xmath0-process studiesit was extended by merging it with a full reaction library from basel university @xcite . that reaction library was mainly based on non - smoker predictions with only few experimental information for light nuclei . for the present calculations ,the library was updated by inclusion of more than 350 experimental and semi - empirical stellar ( @xmath24 ) cross sections from the most recent version of the \`\` karlsruhe astrophysical database of nucleosynthesis in stars '' ( kadonis v0.2 ) . due to detailed balancethis modification also affects the respective ( @xmath25 ) channels .the abundance evolution was tracked with a parameterized reaction network , based on a model of a supernova type ii explosion of a 25 m@xmath11 star @xcite .since the @xmath0-process layers are located far outside the collapsing core , they only experience the explosion shock front passing through the o / ne burning zone and the subsequent temperature and density increase .both , the seed abundances and the respective temperature and density profiles , were taken from @xcite and are not calculated self - consistently .the @xmath0-process zone in the simulation was subdivided into 14 single layers .this is consistent with what was used in @xcite and thus the results can directly be compared .the final @xmath2-process abundances depend very sensitively on the choice of the initial seed abundance .this initial abundance is produced by in - situ modification of the stellar material in various nucleosynthesis processes during stellar evolution .this also means that the respective o / ne layers can receive an abundance contribution from the weak @xmath6 process ( core helium and shell carbon burning during the red giant phase of the massive star ) in the mass region up to @xmath26=90 .the @xmath6-process component depends on the mass of the star and also on the neutron yield provided by the @xmath27ne(@xmath28)@xmath29 mg neutron source .if the @xmath0-process layers during the explosion are located within the convective zones of the previous helium burning phases , the @xmath6-process abundance distribution in all layers can be assumed to be constant .thus , it has to be emphasized that the results strongly depend on the adopted stellar model ( e.g. ref .@xcite found significant @xmath2-processing occurring already in late stages of hydrostatic burning ) .additionally , stars with different masses will exhibit different @xmath6- and @xmath0-processing and true @xmath0-abundances can only be derived when employing models of galactical chemical evolution .nevertheless , for better comparison with previous studies , here we implemented the same approach as used in @xcite ( see also fig .[ opf ] ) .the results of our simulations are shown in fig .[ opf ] as normalized overproduction factors@xmath30@xmath31@xmath32/@xmath33 @xcite .this value gives the produced abundance relative to the solar abundances of anders and grevesse @xcite .ranges of variations of this factor for sn type ii explosions with stellar masses 13  @xmath34@xmath35@xmath3625  @xmath34 are published in fig .  4 of ref .the factor @xmath33 is the so - called averaged overproduction factor which is a measure for the overall enrichment of all @xmath0 isotopes .this value changed only by -0.6% from @xmath33=86.3 ( previous library @xcite ) to @xmath33=85.8 ( modified library ) .the quantities @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 are the mean overproduction factor calculated from the mass of the respective isotope @xmath37 in the @xmath0-process zone divided by the total mass of the @xmath0-process zone times the respective solar mass fraction of the isotope . in fig .[ opf ] our results with the modified reaction library are compared to the results published in @xcite with the previous set of reaction rates to examine the influence of the newly implemented neutron capture data of kadonis v0.2 .the result is a decrease in the normalized overproduction factor for almost all @xmath0 isotopes by an average value of -7% ( shown in the right part of fig .[ opf ] as dashed line ) .the largest deviations occur for @xmath38sr ( -20.5% ) , @xmath39ce ( + 30.6% ) , @xmath40dy ( -39.2% ) , @xmath41gd and @xmath42dy ( -22.3% each ) , @xmath43w , and @xmath44pt ( -32% ) .star model of rayet et al .@xcite are given for comparison ( grey stars ) .a value equal to unity corresponds to the solar abundance .right : abundance difference for each @xmath0 isotope between the modified and the previous reaction library . ]    in general , these differences are relatively strong in the mass region @xmath26=150 - 170 .reaction flux plots of this mass region reveal that the main flux proceeds by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath1 , and @xmath47 reactions , and is lower by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared to the previous reaction library .this drastic change can not be explained by the implementation of larger experimental @xmath1 cross sections of some of these @xmath0 isotopes , since this would in turn also increase the production channel via @xmath46 reactions from heavier isotopes @xcite .surprising at first glance , the cause of the differences are changes in the neutron rates at higher masses . a significant fraction of the seed abundances for the @xmath0 process is located in @xmath48bi and the pb isotopes and converted to nuclei at lower mass by photodisintegration sequences starting with @xmath46 reactions .the importance of experimental data is strongly emphasized by these findings . because of the magicity or near - magicity of the pb and bi isotopes , individual resonances determine the cross sections and hauser - feshbach theory is not applicable @xcite . furthermore , from discrepancies between resonance and activation measurements @xcite and from theoretical considerations @xcite , it has been previously found that a small direct capture component contributes to neutron capture on @xmath49pb @xcite .the interplay of resonant and direct capture contributions is difficult to handle in theoretical models and experiments prove to be indispensable .this also explains why there are deviations up to factor of 1.7 - 2 between the non - smoker predictions and experimental data for these nuclei @xcite .in fact , hauser - feshbach models can not be applied there . for the cases wherethe statistical model can be applied , the average non - smoker uncertainty for stellar @xmath1 cross sections is only @xmath5030% or even better .    the nuclides @xmath41gd and @xmath51er are not produced in the present simulation based on a 25 m@xmath11 star .this is consistent with previous work finding large @xmath6-process contributions to these nuclei .also , the two odd-@xmath26 isotopes @xmath52 in and @xmath53sn are not produced .the latter underproduction problem is known since a long time @xcite .the initial seed abundances of @xmath52 in and @xmath53sn are destroyed by the @xmath2 process , since the destruction channel is much stronger than the production channel .thus , it appears as if the nuclides @xmath41gd , @xmath51er , @xmath52 in , and @xmath53sn have strong contributions from other processes and it is conceivable that they even may not be assigned to the group of @xmath0 nuclei .nemeth et al .@xcite determined the contributions for @xmath52 in , and @xmath53sn with the ( out - dated ) classical @xmath6-process approach to be very small ( less than 1% for both cases ) .these calculations in the cd - in - sn region are complicated since many isomeric states have to be considered , and the @xmath7-process may contribute to the abundances of @xmath52cd and @xmath53 in .although these two isotopes have quasi - stable ground - states , the @xmath54-decays of @xmath7-process progenitor nuclei can proceed via isomeric states : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath56 @xmath52 in and @xmath58cd @xmath56@xmath59 @xmath56 @xmath53sn . in @xciteonly part of the missing abundances could be ascribed to post-@xmath7-process @xmath54-decay chains , leaving rather large residues for other production mechanisms . in view of the progress achieved in @xmath6-process calculations using the tp -

Thermal Management 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Three dimensional packaging extends the high interconnection density which has been achieved using multichip modules to a new dimension. In this paper, we describe the fabrication of an unique 3-dimensional multichip module (3-D MCM) based on AT&Ts Si-on-Si Micro Interconnect technology. Four multichip tiles are interconnected on a multilayer metal-core printing wiring board. Eight such boards are then stacked vertically to form a 3-D module. Compliant anisotropically conductive elastomers are the key element in this design providing electrical interconnection between the stacked boards. The heat generated by the multichip tiles is conducted to the metal-core board and removed by air forced through holes on the perimeter of the boards. This paper describes results of a reliability evaluation of the vertical interconnect scheme. In addition a thermal characterization of the 3-D module is presented. > 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  As electronic packages become more compact, run at faster speeds and dissipate more heat, package designers need more effective thermal management materials. One such material that has excellent thermal conductivity is CVD diamond. Designers have already used CVD diamond successfully in the production of heat sinks for laser diodes and laser diode arrays, and in the design of microwave substrates. As the cost of CVD diamond decreases, designers also are beginning to incorporate CVD diamond into their designs for single-chip packages and multichip modules. > 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Devices are becoming available whose inherent switching speeds are approaching only a few picoseconds. CMOS FET devices with 0.12 micron channel length have exhibited f/sub T/ values of 89 GHz. SiGe HBTs have been demonstrated with an f/sub T/ of 117 GHz. InP/InGaAs/AlGaAs HBT's have exhibited an f/sub T/ of 200 GHz, with minimum feature sizes that are above one micron. InGaAs/AlGaAs MESFET's with 0.05 micron channel lengths have exhibited f/sub T/ values of 350 GHz. Clearly even faster devices are possible, and some have even begun to appear in viable fabrication lines where prospects for interesting levels of integration are being realized. For such technologies subnanosecond machine cycles seem possible. However, for conventional 2D chip or wafer fabrication some of the distances between key components on these substrates can be too long for subnanosecond operation. This may be true even for ideal transmission line interconnections that exhibit \\"speed of light\\" propagation speeds and extremely wide bandwidths. At this point the last resort is to shorten these interconnections by rearranging the components in 3D structures, implying either die or wafer stacking. This paper explores some of the requirements for subnanosecond machine design, and practical schemes to accomplish this with discussion on how to distribute the power supply current and dissipate the heat generated. These schemes use the full array of WSI, WSHP and MCM technologies plus some new techniques for 3D vertical stacking.Literature Review:","answer":"As the demand increases to build high performance systems, trends in electronic package design have moved toward larger chips, higher number of I/O ports, increased circuit density, and improved reliability. Greater circuit density means increased power density (W/cm ). The power density has increased exponentially over the past 15 years and it appears that it will continue to do so in the near future. As is the case with devices fabricated using 3-D technology, the power density is high, so thermal management should be considered carefully. The thermal management in 3-D technology has been addressed at two levels. The first is at the system design level by trying to evenly distribute the thermal energy across the 3-D device surface  . The second is at the packaging level. This is achieved through one or a combination of the following approaches. Firstly, by using low thermal resistance substrates such as diamond BIB001 , BIB004 or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond BIB003 . Secondly, by using forced air or liquid coolant to reduce the 3-D device temperature  , BIB002 . Thirdly, by using a thermally conductive adhesive and implementing thermal vias  between the stacked elements to extract the heat from inside the stack to its surface. Even though, these methods are effective, it is believed thermal management will be more challenging with increased circuits densification."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is a causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia. Although the exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to leukemogenesis is still unclear, the Tax protein is thought to play a major role in this process. This 40-kDa polypeptide is able to interact with the tumor suppressor p16 (INK4A). Consequently, Tax can activate the signaling pathway that lead to the release of E2F that in turn induces expression of factors required for cell cycle progression. In this paper, we demonstrate that Tax can also activate E2F-mediated transcription independently of p16 (INK4A). Indeed, when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells, which lack expression of p16 (INK4A), it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites. This stimulation is abrogated by mutations affecting the E2F-binding sites. In addition, Tax also stimulates the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself. Using Tax mutants that fail to activate either ATF-or NF-kappaB-dependent promoters and different 5' truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter, we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the E2F1 gene involves, at least in part, the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"p16 (INK4A) - negative T - cell line\\", \\"CEM T - cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [\\"E2F - binding sites\\", \\"E2F - 1 promoter\\", \\"ATF binding site\\", \\"E2F - 1 gene\\", \\"5u0027 truncation mutants\\", \\"E2F1 gene\\", \\"E2F binding sites\\", \\"the E2F - binding sites\\", \\"NF - kappaB - dependent promoters\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"ATF\\", \\"human T - cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein\\", \\"E2F - 1\\", \\"E2F\\", \\"p16 (INK4A)\\", \\"Tax\\", \\"tumor suppressor\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"Tax protein\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

A prospective, randomized clinical trial compared amniotic membrane transplant with conjunctival advancement in patients with leaking glaucoma filtering blebs. Intraocular pressure, number of glaucoma medications, and reoperation for glaucoma or persistent or recurrent bleb-leak were compared in the two groups. Patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year.                Mean intraocular pressure was the same at 6 (amniotic membrane transplant, 15.4 +/- 4.4, conjunctival advancement 14.1 +/- 6.4, P = 0.6), 12 (amniotic membrane transplant, 15.0 +/- 6.3, conjunctival advancement, 13.2 +/- 6.6, P = 0.5), and 24 (amniotic membrane transplant, 17.2 +/- 7.1, conjunctival advancement, 15.0 +/- 6.3, P = 0.6) months. The mean number of glaucoma medications in use was the same in the two groups at all time intervals. After an average follow-up of 19 months, there were seven failures in the amniotic membrane transplant group (two with persistent leaks that were unresponsive to further suturing, two with late-onset leaks, and three who required repeat glaucoma surgery) and none in the conjunctival advancement group. The cumulative survival rate for amniotic membrane transplant was 81% at 6 months, 74% at 1 year, and 46% at 2 years. The cumulative survival rate was 100% for conjunctival advancement throughout follow-up.                Amniotic membrane transplantation does not offer an effective alternative to conjunctival advancement for repair of leaking glaucoma filtering blebs.","answer":"Although a variety of treatments have been proposed for bleb leaks, there is no evidence of their comparative effectiveness.The evidence in this review was provided by a single trial that compared two surgical procedures (conjunctival advancement and amniotic membrane transplant). The trial did show a superiority of conjunctival advancement, which was regarded as standard treatment, to amniotic membrane transplantation. There is a need for more randomised trials to validate the findings of this single trial and provide more information on the different types of interventions, especially non-surgical treatments compared to surgical procedures. We recommend that any intervention should be compared to a standard procedure, which is to date conjunctival advancement."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Machine Learning (ML) models are applied in a variety of tasks such as network intrusion detection or Malware classification. Yet, these models are vulnerable to a class of malicious inputs known as adversarial examples. These are slightly perturbed inputs that are classified incorrectly by the ML model. The mitigation of these adversarial inputs remains an open problem. As a step towards understanding adversarial examples, we show that they are not drawn from the same distribution than the original data, and can thus be detected using statistical tests. Using thus knowledge, we introduce a complimentary approach to identify specific inputs that are adversarial. Specifically, we augment our ML model with an additional output, in which the model is trained to classify all adversarial inputs. We evaluate our approach on multiple adversarial example crafting methods (including the fast gradient sign and saliency map methods) with several datasets. The statistical test flags sample sets containing adversarial inputs confidently at sample sizes between 10 and 100 data points. Furthermore, our augmented model either detects adversarial examples as outliers with high accuracy (> 80%) or increases the adversary's cost - the perturbation added - by more than 150%. In this way, we show that statistical properties of adversarial examples are essential to their detection.Literature Review:","answer":"In BIB002 , it uses a statistical test: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test BIB001 , which is used to test whether two datasets are drawn from the same distribution.

The general public feels that cocaine is not particularly dangerous because it does not produce a well defined physical dependency and abstinence syndrome. However, when addiction is defined as compulsion, loss of control and continued use in spite of adverse consequences, cocaine drug hunger can be seen as an agent of addictive disease. Withdrawal from cocaine dependence usually involves depression, anxiety and lethargy. These usually clear within a week, leaving only the \\"drug hunger\\" to contend with. Medication is rarely needed. When cocaine is the primary addiction, after withdrawal the most effective treatment is group therapy with other recovering cocaine abusers. We incorporate the principles of recovery and define positive and constructive alternatives in dealing with cocaine hunger. Recovery programs should be flexible and involve individual and family education on recovery and the nature of addictive disease. Exercise that produces cardiopulmonary stimulation is a helpful means of reducing drug hunger and anxiety during recovery therapy.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"cocaine\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

Methods The VVSymQ ® instrument is a five-item patient-reported outcome that assesses symptoms most important to patients with varicose veins  ( heaviness , achiness , swelling , throbbing and itching ) . This paper describes how the VVSymQ ® instrument was incorporated into an electronic daily diary to monitor key outcomes over time and capture treatment benefit in two r and omized , controlled , phase 3 clinical trials . Results Patients were highly compliant in completing the electronic daily diary , and the VVSymQ ® instrument demonstrated ability to detect overall change and ability to detect change that is meaningful to patients . Conclusion The VVSymQ ® instrument is a reliable , valid instrument responsive to measuring change in the patient experience of varicose vein symptoms pre- and post-intervention , and is uniquely focused on patient-reported symptoms compared with other widely used question naires completed by cliniciansTitle 2:Progression of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency in the general population in the Edinburgh Vein Study.Abstract 2:OBJECTIVE The natural history in the general population of chronic venous disease in the legs is not well understood . This has limited our ability to predict which patients will deteriorate and to assign clinical priorities . The aims of this study were to describe the progression of trunk varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency ( CVI ) in the general population , to identify important lifestyle and clinical prognostic factors , and to determine the relationship between venous reflux and progression . METHODS The Edinburgh Vein Study is a population -based cohort study in which r and omly selected adults aged 18 to 64 years had an examination at baseline . This included a question naire on lifestyle  and  clinical factors  ,  st and ardized assessment and classification of venous disease in the legs , and duplex scan to detect venous reflux in eight segments of each leg . A follow-up examination 13 years later included a reclassification of venous disease to ascertain progression in the development or increase in severity of varicose veins and CVI . RESULTS Among 1566 adults seen at baseline , 880 had a follow-up examination , of whom 334 had trunk varicose veins or CVI at baseline and composed the study sample . The mean ( st and ard deviation ) duration of follow-up was 13.4 ( 0.4 ) years . Progression was found in 193 ( 57.8 % ) , equivalent to 4.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 3.7 - 4.9 ) annually . In 270 subjects with only varicose veins at baseline , 86 ( 31.9 % ) developed CVI , with the rate increasing consistently with age ( P = .04 ) . Almost all subjects ( 98 % ) with both varicose veins and CVI at baseline deteriorated . Progression of chronic venous disease did not differ by gender or leg , but a family history of varicose veins and history of deep venous thrombosis increased risk ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.85 [ 95 % CI , 1.14 - 1.30 ] and 4.10 [ 95 % CI , 1.07 - 15.71 ] , respectively ) . Overweight was associated with increased risk of CVI in those with varicose veins ( OR , 1.85 ; 95 % CI , 1.10 - 3.12 ) . Reflux in the superficial system increased the likelihood of progression , especially in combination with deep reflux ( OR , 2.57 ; 95 % CI , 1.55 - 4.25 ) and when located in the small saphenous vein ( OR , 4.73 ; 95 % CI , 1.37 - 16.39 ) . CONCLUSIONS Nearly half of the general population with chronic venous disease deteriorated during 13 years , and almost one third with varicose veins developed skin changes of CVI , increasing their risk of ulceration . Age , family history of varicose veins , history of deep venous thrombosis , overweight , and superficial reflux , especially in the small saphenous vein and with deep reflux , might influence the risk of progression","answer":"The overall key theme to emerge was adaptation , with patients demonstrating how they adapted to the various impacts .This review demonstrates that varicose veins have a wide range of symptoms and may have a significant impact on quality of life ; people made significant adaptations to enable them to live their lives as fully as possible .The use of PROMs to gather information about quality of life and symptoms is well established globally ; however , PROMs currently used may not capture the full extent of the impact on patient 's quality of life"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Bolm, Chem. Eur. J.2019, 25, 12708.</p><p>In memory of Professor Dr. Dieter Enders</p><p>Polysulfones are a family of plastic materials that are noted for their high thermal and oxidative stability.1 They are being used within fluid handling components, steam sterilizable biomedical moldings as well as in a range of chemical process and automotive applications.2 Some of us recently reported a series of BN‐doped inorganic–organic hybrid polymers,3, 4, 5, 6 including the first poly(p‐phenylene iminoborane), which can be regarded as a BN‐analogue of poly(p‐phenylene vinylene) (PPV).3d A dapson‐type diaryl sulfone was also incorporated into a polymeric material.3e</p><p>Formal exchange of a sulfonyl oxygen by a nitrogen atom converts a sulfone into a sulfoximine. The latter compounds are relevant in asymmetric synthesis7 and applications in medicinal8 and crop protection chemistry.9 Functionalizing the sulfoximine nitrogen allows a fine‐tuning of physicochemical properties, which proved useful in drug design and bioactivity adjustment.10 Surprisingly, sulfoximines have only once been applied as building blocks in polymers.11 In that study, Takata et al. used Friedel–Crafts reactions to prepare polysulfoximines with molecular weights (Mn) of approximately 13 000. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of the first inorganic–organic hybrid polysulfoximines.</p><p>In light of previous work,12 sulfoximines 1 and 2 were identified as suitable organic starting materials. Both compounds were N‐methylated, thereby confining the reactive anchor sites of the molecules to the free arylic amino and hydroxyl groups. With the vision to allow future variations of the N‐substituent, phthalimid‐ and benzyl‐protected NH‐sulfoximines 4 and 7, respectively, were targeted first. The synthetic sequences are shown in Scheme 1. The preparation of 1 started from known diarylsulfide 3,12 which was imidated and oxidized by adopting a protocol reported by Luisi, Bull, and others13 to give 4 in 62 % yield. Noteworthy, we applied aqueous ammonia as a nitrogen source instead of the originally suggested ammonium carbamate.</p><p>Syntheses of key intermediates 1 and 2.</p><p>N‐Methylation under standard Eschweiler–Clark conditions afforded sulfoximine 5 (21 %), which was deprotected with hydrazine in ethanol to give 1 in 61 % yield. Following an analogous reaction sequence, sulfoximine 2 was prepared by imidation/oxidation of 614 to give 7 (64 %) followed by N‐methylation with MeI in KOH/DMSO15 providing 8 in 48 % yield and sequential debenzylation with BBr3 (98 %).</p><p>Targeting a polymer formation by silicon/boron exchange, bis(silylated) sulfoximine 9 was prepared, in analogy of literature precedence,16 by treatment of 1 with a mixture of Me3SiCl and Et3N in THF at 45 °C for 24 h. The coupling partner for 9 was bis(bromoborane) 103d (Tip=2,4,6‐triisopropylphenyl). Two co‐polycondensation reactions were performed (Scheme 2). In both cases, a 1:1 ratio of 9 and 10 was applied. In the first experiment (trial 1), the mixture was kept in dichloromethane for 3 days at ambient temperature. Trial 2 involved o‐difluorobenzene (o‐DFB) as the solvent and heating the mixture to 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting alternating copolymers 11 were then purified by precipitation from concentrated solution with hexane and subsequent drying in vacuo. The identities of copolymers 11, which were obtained as off‐white solids, were unambiguously ascertained by NMR spectroscopy. Their molecular mass distributions were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Table 1). For both samples, the 1H NMR spectrum showed a shift of the NH‐Signal from δ=3.77 ppm in 9 to the aromatic region in 11 (δ=7.25 ppm), which was also observed in previously prepared related BN polymers.3d</p><p>Polycondensation reaction of sulfoximine 9 and bisborane 10 to give alternating copolymer 11.</p><p>GPC data of polymers 11 and 15 (against polystyrene standards).</p><p></p><p>Mn</p><p>MW</p><p>PDI</p><p>DPn</p><p>11 (trial 1)[a]</p><p>9 750</p><p>18 600</p><p>1.91</p><p>13</p><p>11 (trial 2)[b]</p><p>11 830</p><p>28 900</p><p>2.44</p><p>15</p><p>15 (trial 1)[a]</p><p>2400</p><p>2970</p><p>1.52</p><p>3</p><p>15 (trial 2)[b]</p><p>5300</p><p>9740</p><p>1.84</p><p>7</p><p>[a] Prepared in dichloromethane (DCM), rt, 3 d.

The polydispersity indices were close to 2, as expected for step‐growth polycondensation processes.</p><p>Next, copolymers with main‐chain B−O linkages17 were targeted. Hypothesizing that such products could be accessed by analogous Si/B exchange reactions as applied before in the synthesis of 11, organic starting materials with silylated phenolic hydroxyl groups became of interest. In order to get an estimate of the feasibility of such an approach, a prior model reaction between 10 and trimethylsilylated phenol 12 was performed (Scheme 3). In the first experiment, the reaction was run in dichloromethane at room temperature. As hypothesized, product 14 was indeed formed as revealed by 1H and 11B NMR spectroscopy. The initial presence of two doublets (δ=8.04 and 7.88 ppm) in the 1H NMR spectrum suggested a stepwise formation of 14. However, the entire process was very slow, and even after four weeks the conversion was not yet complete. A similar outcome resulted when o‐difluorobenzene was used as a solvent at a reaction temperature of 80 °C. Also in this case, the conversion was slow, taking five weeks in total. Although these results showed that a Si/B exchange could, in principle, be applied to accomplish a B−O bond formation starting from 10, the slow rate of this process proved unfavorable for its application to co‐polycondensation reactions. Therefore, we decided to investigate B−O bond formation between 10 and the parent free phenol (13).</p><p>Model reactions testing the feasibility of Si/B exchange and salt elimination reactions in the formation of alternating copolymers with B−O linkages.</p><p>While initial attempts without base remained unsatisfying, the presence of triethylamine had a tremendously positive effect, leading to a clean and quantitative coupling providing 14 within 24 hours at room temperature. Compound 14 was then isolated by filtration and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The 11B{1H} NMR spectrum showed a resonance at δ=47.3 ppm, which is in the expected range for the suggested constitution.</p><p>Encouraged by this result, the aforementioned conditions were applied in the copolymerization of sulfoximine 2 with bisborane 10 (Scheme 4). Within three days in the presence of Et3N, the dichloromethane solution became highly viscous (trial 1). However, after work‐up the GPC analysis revealed that the product was of relatively low molecular weight (Mn=2 400, DPn=3; Table 1). Consequently, in the next experiment (trial 2) the solvent was changed to o‐DFB, and then the reaction temperature was raised to 80 °C. Pleasingly, in this manner, after 24 h the molecular weight (Mn) of the resulting polymer 15 was increased to 5 300, revealing an average chain length of DPn=7 (Table 1).18</p><p>Polycondensation reaction of sulfoximine 2 and bisborane 10 to give alternating copolymer 15.</p><p>In summary, we have prepared the first inorganic–organic hybrid sulfoximine‐containing polymers as alternating copolymers with B=N and B−O linkages. While our Si/B exchange polycondensation protocol was successful in the former case, for the synthesis of polymers with B−O linkages in the main chain a salt elimination approach proved to be favorable.

In a two-year period, 292 patients with acute myocardial infarction were admitted to the coronary intensive care unit, 40 were included in the study. Afterwards, patients were divided in two groups: early cardiogenic and late cardiogenic shock, and they were assigned randomly and blind to treatment with inotropics and inotropics plus intra-aortic balloon pump.                There were significant differences in the measurements of pulmonary wedge pressure (20.4 +/- 1.6 vs 24.4 +/- 1.50, p = 0.0004) and the cardiac index (2.06 +/- 0.7 vs 1.65 +/- 0.18, p = 0.0002) between the two groups. The late cardiogenic shock group showed an increased mortality (25.9% vs 61.5%, p < 0.05). Patients treated with inotropics + balloon, in both early and late shock groups, showed a reduction in mortality of 66% and 69%, respectively.                The use of the intra-aortic balloon pump in the treatment of cardiogenic shock post acute myocardial infarction reduces the mortality when associated with the use of inotropics and reperfusion.Title 2:Randomized comparison of intra-aortic balloon support with a percutaneous left ventricular assist device in patients with revascularized acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock.Abstract 2:Mortality in cardiogenic shock (CS) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains unacceptably high despite percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the infarcted artery and use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation. A newly developed percutaneous left ventricular assist device (VAD) (Tandem Heart, Cardiac Assist, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with active circulatory support might have positive haemodynamic effects and decrease mortality.                Patients in CS after AMI, with intended PCI of the infarcted artery, were randomized to either IABP (n=20) or percutaneous VAD support (n=21). The primary outcome measure cardiac power index, as well as other haemodynamic and metabolic variables, could be improved more effectively by VAD support from 0.22 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.19-0.30] to 0.37 W/m2 (IQR 0.30-0.47, P<0.001) when compared with IABP from 0.22 (IQR 0.18-0.30) to 0.28 W/m2 (IQR 0.24-0.36, P=0.02; P=0.004 for intergroup comparison). However, complications like severe bleeding (n=19 vs. n=8, P=0.002) or limb ischaemia (n=7 vs. n=0, P=0.009) were encountered more frequently after VAD support, whereas 30 day mortality was similar (IABP 45% vs. VAD 43%, log-rank, P=0.86).                Haemodynamic and metabolic parameters can be reversed more effectively by VAD than by standard treatment with IABP. However, more complications were encountered by the highly invasive procedure and by the extracorporeal support.Title 3:A randomized multicenter clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device versus conventional therapy with intraaortic balloon pumping for treatment of cardiogenic shock.Abstract 3:Despite major advances in the treatment of heart failure, cardiogenic shock (CGS) remains associated with substantial mortality. Recent data suggest that the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) may be useful in the management of CGS. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to test the hypothesis that the TandemHeart (pVAD) provides superior hemodynamic support compared with intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP).                Forty-two patients from 12 centers presenting within 24 hours of developing CGS were included in the study and treated in an initial roll-in phase (n = 9) or randomized to treatment with IABP (n = 14) or TandemHeart pVAD (n = 19). Thirty patients (71%) had persistent CGS despite having an IABP in place at the time of study enrollment.                Cardiogenic shock was due to myocardial infarction in 70% of the patients and decompensated heart failure in most of the remaining patients. The mean duration of support was 2.5 days. Compared with IABP, the TandemHeart pVAD achieved significantly greater increases in cardiac index and mean arterial blood pressure and significantly greater decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Overall 30-day survival and severe adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 groups.                In patients presenting within 24 hours of the development of CGS, TandemHeart significantly improves hemodynamic parameters, even in patients failing IABP. Larger-scale studies are required to assess the influence of improved hemodynamics on survival.Title 4:Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock: the prospective, randomized IABP SHOCK Trial for attenuation of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.Abstract 4:Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock (CS) are often treated with intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation (IABP), even though the evidence to support this is limited. We determined whether IABP as an addition to PCI-centered therapy ameliorates multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by CS.                A prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial recruiting patients between March 2003 and June 2004 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00469248).                Tertiary care university hospital.                Forty-five consecutive patients with AMI and CS undergoing PCI were randomized to treatment with or without IABP.                Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores (primary outcome measure), hemodynamic values, inflammatory markers, and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (secondary outcomes) were collected over 4 days from randomization. The prospective hypothesis was that adding IABP therapy to \\"standard care\\" would improve CS-triggered MODS. The addition of IABP to standard therapy did not result in a significant improvement in MODS (measured by serial APACHE II scoring over 4 days). IABP use had no significant effect on cardiac index or systemic inflammatory activation, although BNP levels were significantly lower in IABP-treated patients. Initial and serial APACHE II scoring correlated with mortality better than cardiac index, systemic inflammatory state, and BNP levels in this group of patients. Nonsurvivors had significantly higher initial APACHE II scores (29.9 +/- 2.88) than survivors (18.1 +/- 1.66, p < .05). Nevertheless, discrepancies among patients within the groups cannot be ruled out and might interfere with our results.                In this randomized trial addressing addition of IABP in CS patients, mechanical support was associated only with modest effects on reduction of APACHE II score as a marker of severity of disease, improvement of cardiac index, reduction of inflammatory state, or reduction of BNP biomarker status compared with medical therapy alone. However, the limitations of our present trial preclude any definitive conclusion, but request for a larger prospective, randomized, multicentered trial with mortality as primary end point.Title 5:A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device versus intra-aortic balloon pumping for treatment of cardiogenic shock caused by myocardial infarction.Abstract 5:The aim of this study was to test whether the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Impella LP2.5 (Abiomed Europe GmbH, Aachen, Germany) provides superior hemodynamic support compared with the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).                Cardiogenic shock caused by left ventricular failure is associated with high mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). An LVAD may help to bridge patients to recovery from left ventricular failure.                In a prospective, randomized study, 26 patients with cardiogenic shock were studied. The primary end point was the change of the cardiac index (CI) from baseline to 30 min after implantation. Secondary end points included lactic acidosis, hemolysis, and mortality after 30 days.                In 25 patients the allocated device (n = 13 IABP, n = 12 Impella LP2.5) could be safely placed. One patient died before implantation. The CI after 30 min of support was significantly increased in patients with the Impella LP2.5 compared with patients with IABP (Impella: DeltaCI = 0.49 +/- 0.46 l/min/m(2); IABP: DeltaCI = 0.11 +/- 0.31 l/min/m(2); p = 0.02). Overall 30-day mortality was 46% in both groups.                In patients presenting with cardiogenic shock caused by AMI, the use of a percutaneously placed LVAD (Impella LP 2.5) is feasible and safe, and provides superior hemodynamic support compared with standard treatment using an intra-aortic balloon pump.

Ji et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2019; Ebisu and Ichise, 2018; Nickel et al., 2011; Kazemi and Poole, 2018; Trouillon et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019) .The general methodology of these models is to model entities and relations in vector spaces based on a score function for triplets (h, r, t).The score function measures the plausibility of each candidate triplet (h, r, t) compared to corrupted false triplets (h , r, t) or (h, r, t ).However, traditional KGE models often suffer from limited knowledge representation due to the simply symbolic representation of entities and relations.Some recent works take advantages of both fact triplets and textual description to enrich knowledge representation (Socher et al., 2013a; Xu et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2016; , but without exploitation of contextual information of the textual descriptions.Moreover, much of this research effort has been dedicated to developing novel architectures for knowledge representation without applications to KGE models.Unlike many existing works which try to propose new architectures for KGEs or knowledge representation, we focus on model-agnostic pretraining technique for KGE models.We present a unified training framework named as PretrainKGEs which consists of three phases: fine-tuning phase, initializing phase and training phase (see Fig. 1 ).During the fine-tuning phase, we learn better knowledgeable entity and relation representations via pretrained language models using textual descriptions as input sequence.Different from previous works incorporating textual information into knowledge representation, we use pretrained langauge models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to better understand textual description by making full use of syntactic and semantic information in large- scale corpora on which BERT is pretrained.Thus, we enable to incorporate rich linguistic knowledge learned by BERT into entity and relation representations.Then during the initializing phase, we use knowledgeable entity and relation representations to initialize entity and relation embeddings so that the initialized KGEs inherit the rich knowledge.Finally, during the training phase, we train a KGE model the same way as a traditional KGE model to learn entity and relation embeddings.Extensive experiments using six public KGE models across four benchmark KG datasets show that our proposed training framework can consistently improve results and achieve state-of-the-art performance in link prediction and triplet classification tasks.Our contributions are as follows:• We propose a model-agnostic training framework for learning knowledge graph embeddings by first learning knowledge representation via pretrained language models.• Results on several benchmark datasets show that our method can improve results and achieve state-of-the-art performance over variants of knowledge graph embedding models in link prediction and triplet classification tasks.• Further analysis demonstrates the effects of knowledge incorporation in our method and shows that our Pretrain-KGEs outperforms baselines especially in the case of fewer training triplets, low-frequency and the out-ofknowledge-base (OOKB) entities.2 Background and Related WorkWe present Pretrain-KGEs, a simple and efficient pretraining technique for knowledge graph embedding models.Pretrain-KGEs is a general technique that can be applied to any KGE model.It contributes to learn better knowledgeable entity and relation representations from pretrained language models, which are leveraged during the initializing and the training phases for a KGE model to learn entity and relation embeddings.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performances using this effective pretraining technique on various benchmark datasets.Further, we verify the effectiveness of our method by demonstrating promising results in the case of fewer training triplets, infrequent and OOKB entities which are particularly hard to handle due to lack of knowledge representation.We finally analyze the effects of knowledge incorporation by demonstrating the sensitivity of MR and MRR metrics and visualizing the process of knowledge incorporation.A Detailed Implementation A.1Implementation Our implementations of TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) , DistMult , ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) , RotatE (Sun et al., 2019) , pRotatE (Sun et al., 2019) are based on the framework provided by Sun et al.

MICROGRIDS TO SUPPORT GRID PERFORMANCE 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The microgrid, as defined by the U.S. Department of Energy, is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources (DERs) with clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the electric utility grid. DERs consist of distributed generation (DG) and distributed energy storage (DES) installed at utility facilities, e.g., distribution substations, DG sites, or consumer premises. A microgrid must have three distinct characteristics: 1) the electrical boundaries must be clearly defined, 2) there must be control systems in place to dispatch DERs in a coordinated fashion and maintain voltage and frequency within acceptable limits, and 3) the aggregated installed capacity of DERs and controllable loads must be adequate to reliably supply the critical demand. The microgrids may be operated in two modes.Literature Review:","answer":"In BIB002 , several value propositions of community microgrids are enumerated which could be simply extended to a majority of types of microgrids. These value propositions include improved reliability and resiliency, emission reduction, reduced costs of recurring system upgrades, enhancing energy efficiency and power quality, and lowered energy costs. However, the microgrid value propositions, which are of utmost importance and appeal for grid operators to support grid performance, are improved reliability, resiliency, and power quality. The study in BIB001 describes the primary value propositions of microgrids including reliability, energy arbitrage, and power quality. Furthermore, requirements and characteristics are discussed for microgrids designed for each of the value propositions."},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

This is evident most compellingly by the very low recognition rate of all existing face recognition systems when applied to live CCTV camera input. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework to perform multi-modal (such as variations in viewpoint and illumination) face image super-resolution for recognition in tensor space. Given a single modal low-resolution face image, we benefit from the multiple factor interactions of training tensor, and super-resolve its high-resolution reconstructions across different modalities for face recognition. Instead of performing pixel-domain super-resolution and recognition independently as two separate sequential processes, we integrate the tasks of super-resolution and recognition by directly computing a maximum likelihood identity parameter vector in high-resolution tensor space for recognition. We show results from multi-modal super-resolution and face recognition experiments across different imaging modalities, using low-resolution images as testing inputs and demonstrate improved recognition rates over standard tensorface and eigenface representations.","answer":"[[\\"live CCTV camera input\\", \\"face recognition systems\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"high-resolution reconstructions\\", \\"recognition\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"low-resolution images\\", \\"multi-modal super-resolution and face recognition\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"Bayesian framework\\", \\"face image super-resolution\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"maximum likelihood identity parameter vector\\", \\"face image super-resolution\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"high-resolution tensor space\\", \\"maximum likelihood identity parameter vector\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"face image super-resolution\\", \\"recognition\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"single modal low-resolution face image\\", \\"high-resolution reconstructions\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"viewpoint\\", \\"illumination\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"face image super-resolution\\", \\"pixel-domain super-resolution and recognition\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"face image super-resolution\\", \\"recognition\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"recognition rate\\", \\"face recognition systems\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"tensor space\\", \\"recognition\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"recognition rates\\", \\"tensorface and eigenface representations\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"recognition rates\\", \\"multi-modal super-resolution and face recognition\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"maximum likelihood identity parameter vector\\", \\"recognition\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"recognition\\", \\"pixel-domain super-resolution and recognition\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"modalities\\", \\"high-resolution reconstructions\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"multiple factor interactions of training tensor\\", \\"high-resolution reconstructions\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

SEMANTIC VOCABULARY 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Knowledge based approaches to text information retrieval are aimed at increasing the precision of retrieval. In this paper we show that query enhancement through the use of domain ontological structures can enhance the quality of retrieval to a large extent. We have presented a formal framework for extending user queries with domain ontological structures. The query-expansion mechanism has been implemented as a client-side query processor which can use any efficient search engine like Google or Alta Vista at the back end. The approach offers substantial performance gains. We have established the effectiveness of the approach experimentally through the use of single and multiple ontologies.Literature Review:","answer":"A knowledge structure can be domain-specific (describing the classification of a specified domain) or general (for instance, Cyc and EuroWordNet). Concepts, relations between concepts and the properties of concepts constitute the vocabulary of the knowledge structure, thereby leveraging the selection of semantically rich terms for QE. However, according to  and BIB001 , the performance of QE is highly dependent on the quality of the vocabulary, for instance, its accuracy, completeness and up-to-date representation of knowledge.

Antimicrobial activity of GL (the aqueous extract from the carpophores of Ganoderma lucidum (FR)KARST) was tested in vitro against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria by serial broth dilution method, and the antimicrobial activity was expressed by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Among fifteen species of bacteria tested, the antimicrobial activity of GL was the most potent against Micrococcus luteus (MIC, 0.75 mg/ml). To investigate the effects of antimicrobial combinations of GL with four kinds of antibiotics (ampicillin, cefazolin, oxytetracycline and chloramphenicol), the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was determined by checkerboard assay for each strain. The antimicrobial combinations of GL with four antibiotics resulted in additive effect in most instances, synergism in two instances, and antagonism in two instances.

It is unclear if the presence of GI symptoms is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. We aim to assess if GI symptoms could be used for prognostication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to a tertiary medical center in Brooklyn, NY, from March 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020, with COVID-19. The patients' medical charts were reviewed for the presence of GI symptoms at admission, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms (cases) were compared with COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (control). RESULTS: A total of 150 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included, of which 31 (20.6%) patients had at least 1 or more of the GI symptoms (cases). They were compared with the 119 COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (controls). The average age among cases was 57.6 years (SD 17.2) and control was 63.3 years (SD 14.6). No statistically significant difference was noted in comorbidities and laboratory findings. The primary outcome was mortality, which did not differ between cases and controls (41.9 vs. 37.8%, p = 0.68). No statistically significant differences were noted in secondary outcomes, including the length of stay (LOS, 7.8 vs. 7.9 days, p = 0.87) and need for mechanical ventilation (29 vs. 26.9%, p = 0.82). DISCUSSION: In our study, the presence of GI manifestations in COVID-19 at the time of admission was not associated with increased mortality, LOS, or mechanical ventilation.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\", \\"Treatment\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

We therefore present the use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Multi-Rule Quality Control System (MRQCS) to compare knowledge transfer for the two pre-laboratory lecture delivery modes received during a supplemental learning experiment.</p>Research Design<p>In the following study, two laboratory experiments were monitored in which all participants (>18 years old) were enrolled as part of their normal laboratory curriculum. Students were selected by convenience sampling of laboratory sections, and students had the same instructor throughout the period of the study. Beer-Lambert's Law and spectrophotometric absorbance measurements were introduced to students in a foundational learning experiment. During this foundational experiment, students used a Beer-Lambert's Law calibration curve to determine the amount of red food coloring in common soft drinks (see supporting information for instructor and student laboratory guides).(4) The foundational learning experiment was instructor-led, and participant performance was evaluated against the instructors' characterized performance using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Multi-Rule Quality Control System (MRQCS).(5) The second laboratory experiment was a supplemental learning experiment in which students were asked to build upon the methodology they learned in the foundational learning experiment and apply it to a different analyte of interest. In this experiment, participants used a biuret method combined with a Beer-Lambert plot to determine the aspartame concentration in an unknown (see supporting information for laboratory protocol and instructor guide).(6) Performance was evaluated in the same way for this experiment using CDC's MRQCS, but the instruction type was varied randomly between two delivery modes: 1) participants receiving either instructor-led pre-laboratory instruction or 2) participants receiving computer-led pre-laboratory instruction.</p><p>Participants were from four academic institutions, varying in two- and four-year degree programs (granting both Associates and Bachelors degrees) and enrolled in either general or analytical chemistry laboratory. Participant performance was not evaluated until both laboratory experiments were completed and all data was submitted for analysis. Laboratory instructors also submitted system characterization data sets for each laboratory experiment. The system was defined as the laboratory, the laboratory's spectrophotometers, and a particular lot of quality control (QC) materials containing the analyte of interest. Performance parameters for the system were established using the characterization data set submitted by the instructors and was used to evaluate successful application of the experiment by the participants. A characterization data set consisted of at least 20 analytical analyses carried out by laboratory instructors, each containing a calibration curve and high- and low-level quality control (QC) materials. No more than two analyses were performed daily, and the characterization was conducted over the course of two to four weeks.</p><p>For the supplemental learning experiment, the content of the instructor-led and computer-led pre-laboratories were the same. The computer-led curriculum was developed using Lectora Inspire vX.6 (8457), ©Trivantis Corporation 2010 (Figure 1). The computer-led instruction consisted of content slides and interactive questions capable of providing immediate feedback on student responses and emailing student responses to instructors prior to the laboratory. The computer-led pre-laboratory was completed by participants prior to the laboratory experiment, and since no technical difficulties were reported by the participants, application of the software was not suspected to affect the final laboratory assessment outcomes. Knowledge transfer was evaluated for both the instructor- and computer-led laboratory lectures using the MRQCS.</p>Data Collection and Analysis<p>The MRQCS was used to evaluate a single lot of QC materials in each laboratory's experiments. The benefits of this evaluative technique were that false assay rejections were reduced when compared to single rule QC procedures. Each laboratory experiment was validated in one laboratory, transferred to the three additional laboratories, and characterized in all four of the laboratories. The characterization data generated by the laboratory instructors was used to establish QC parameters for subsequent data collected within each laboratory system. The participants' data were evaluated against the QC parameters established by the instructors using the MRQCS (Figure 1). All enrolled students (n=77), including general chemistry students and advanced analytical chemistry students, participated in the foundational laboratory with only the instructor-led pre- laboratory lecture. The same students then participated in the supplemental learning laboratory but were randomly separated into groups that received either instructor- or computer-led pre-laboratory lectures, respectively. Both groups still had access to the instructor during the laboratory session and were allowed to ask questions. A flow-chart describing the foundational and supplemental laboratories is provided in Figure 2A. Of the 77 participants who collected data for analysis in both laboratories, only 54 participants passed the foundational laboratory. Only these 54 students' data were used to evaluate the success of the delivery modes in the second laboratory since these participants were the only ones who demonstrated mastery of the foundational knowledge and method transfer. The resulting MRQCS evaluation of laboratory application outcomes is provided in Figure 2B. Sample populations were compared by two population proportions, and the p-value was determined using the standard normal (Z-) distribution table.(7)</p>Data Interpretation<p>In the foundational learning experiment, there was no statistical difference found between participants with either a general or advanced background (students enrolled in analytical chemistry laboratory) in chemistry laboratory experience. The passing rates of the general and advanced students were 81 and 83 %, respectively (Figure 2B). The passing rate for the laboratory activity was evaluated based on a QC comparison to the laboratory's characterized QC values using the MRQCS. These passing rates indicate that both the general and advanced populations were successfully provided the knowledge and skills needed in order to complete the foundational learning exercise.</p><p>A comparison of the pre-laboratory lecture delivery platform for the supplemental learning laboratory revealed no significant difference between the instructor-led and computer-led training. The modes of delivery were assigned randomly, and both groups included both general and advanced students. The instructor-led participants passed 86% of the runs, whereas the computer-led participants passed 85% of the runs, demonstrating that the computer-led supplemental learning was as effective as instructor-led supplemental learning. The advanced students had a 100% QC pass rate for the supplemental learning, while general students had a 76.5% and 76.2% pass rate for instructor- and computer-led, respectively. A statistically significant difference (p-value < 0.01) was seen between the general and advanced students in the supplemental laboratory, however, with the more advanced group demonstrating higher levels of assay precision and accuracy compared to the group with only general laboratory experience. This result was not unexpected since the second experiment was supplemental to the first, and the advanced participants had additional laboratory experience. In fact, all the participants from the advanced group passed the supplemental exercise. This result further supported that whether the advanced-level participants were subjected to computer-based learning or instructor-led lecture, they were able to successfully complete the laboratory experiment, likely due to the benefits of their additional experience in laboratory training.</p>Discussion<p>The laboratory design including foundational and supplementary learning was based on Lev Vgotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), also known as scaffolding.(8) Students were projected to experience two of the three zones in ZPD. The initial foundational learning experience introduced the students to Beer-Lambert's Law, where most students were expected to experience learning in their comfort zone, or ZPD zone 1. The second laboratory experiment or supplemental learning experience built upon the students' ZPD zone 1 learning. New topics such as reaction chemistry, which required mixing and a wait time before analysis, were added to the supplemental laboratory, where the majority of students were expected to experience proximal development, or the ZPD zone 2. It was also during the supplemental learning laboratory that students received either instructor- or computer-led pre-laboratory lectures. An evaluation of the knowledge transfer during the two lecture delivery modes was completed using the MRQCS.</p><p>The MRQCS has provided QC evaluation for millions of measurements at CDC, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.(5, 9) The MRQCS employs multiple QC pools and evaluates both within-run and among-run variability. The multiple rules allow the QC system to detect unacceptable systematic or random error. The advantage of multi-rule as opposed to single-rule QC systems is the decrease of false-rejections while maintaining high-confidence in the accepted or passing runs.(10) For example, in this study, a single-rule QC system would have rejected any result outside of two standard deviations from the mean. The MRQCS, on the other hand, applied additional rules to evaluate a run outside of two standard deviations, such as determining if the preceding run was also outside of two standard deviations.</p><p>There have been a number of evaluations of laboratory training,(11–13) but the one reported here uses application-based outcomes to inform the instructor of successful knowledge and method transfer. By applying the MRQCS to evaluate the two lecture delivery modes during a supplemental learning experiment, no significant difference was observed between the computer-based and instructor-based pre-laboratory lectures. These results suggest that computer-led pre-laboratory instruction can be used as an alternative to traditional instructor-led instruction for supplementary learning.</p>CONCLUSION<p>Since instructor-led training can be difficult to accommodate in a larger population, through distance learning, or during inter-laboratory exercises, it is important to evaluate the capability of different modes of knowledge and method transfer. This study uses CDC's previously published MRQCS to provide a statistical evaluation of data obtained during a supplementary learning experiment. The delivery mode for the supplemental learning experiment was varied to compare instructor- and computer-based lectures. The MRQCS was successfully applied and used to determine that no significant difference was observed between the two modes of delivery for the supplementary experiment. These results suggest that computer-led pre-laboratory instruction is an operative alternative to traditional instructor-led training in supplementary learning laboratories.</p>","answer":"The Multi-Rule Quality Control System (MRQCS) is a tool currently employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to evaluate and compare laboratory performance. We have applied the MRQCS to a comparison of instructor and computer-led pre-laboratory lectures for a supplemental learning experiment. Students in general chemistry and analytical chemistry from both two- and four-year institutions performed two laboratory experiments as part of their normal laboratory curriculum. The first laboratory experiment was a foundational learning experiment in which all the students were introduced to Beer-Lambertxe2x80x99s Law and spectrophotometric light absorbance measurements. The foundational learning experiment was instructor-led only, and participant performance was evaluated against a mean characterized value. The second laboratory experiment was a supplemental learning experiment in which students were asked to build upon the methodology they learned in the foundational learning experiment and apply it to a different analyte. The instruction type was varied randomly into two delivery modes, participants receiving either instructor-led or computer-led pre-laboratory instruction. The MRQCS was applied and determined that no statistical difference was found to exist in the QC (quality control) passing rates between the participants in the instructor-led instruction and the participants in the computer-led instruction. These findings demonstrate the successful application of the MRQCS to evaluate knowledge and technology transfer."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

This is further complicated by the effect of episodic exacerbations of the disease, defined as worsening of disease symptoms including wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness (Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010) . Such exacerbations are due to the effect of enhanced acute airway inflammation impacting upon and worsening the symptoms of the existing disease (Hashimoto et al., 2008; Viniol and Vogelmeier, 2018) . These acute exacerbations are the main cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality in patients, as well as resulting in major economic burdens worldwide. However, due to the complex interactions between the host and the exacerbation agents, the mechanisms of exacerbation may vary considerably in different individuals under various triggers. Acute exacerbations are usually due to the presence of environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, smoke, cold or dry air and pathogenic microbes in the airway (Gautier and Charpin, 2017; Viniol and Vogelmeier, 2018) . These agents elicit an immune response leading to infiltration of activated immune cells that further release inflammatory mediators that cause acute symptoms such as increased mucus production, cough, wheeze and shortness of breath. Among these agents, viral infection is one of the major drivers of asthma exacerbations accounting for up to 80-90% and 45-80% of exacerbations in children and adults respectively (Grissell et al., 2005; Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010; Jartti and Gern, 2017; Adeli et al., 2019) . Viral involvement in COPD exacerbation is also equally high, having been detected in 30-80% of acute COPD exacerbations (Kherad et al., 2010; Jafarinejad et al., 2017; Stolz et al., 2019) . Whilst the prevalence of viral exacerbations in CRS is still unclear, its prevalence is likely to be high due to the similar inflammatory nature of these diseases (Rowan et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2017) . One of the reasons for the involvement of respiratory viruses' in exacerbations is their ease of transmission and infection (Kutter et al., 2018) . In addition, the high diversity of the respiratory viruses may also contribute to exacerbations of different nature and severity (Busse et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2014; Jartti and Gern, 2017) . Hence, it is important to identify the exact mechanisms underpinning viral exacerbations in susceptible subjects in order to properly manage exacerbations via supplementary treatments that may alleviate the exacerbation symptoms or prevent severe exacerbations. While the lower airway is the site of dysregulated inflammation in most chronic airway inflammatory diseases, the upper airway remains the first point of contact with sources of exacerbation. Therefore, their interaction with the exacerbation agents may directly contribute to the subsequent responses in the lower airway, in line with the \\"United Airway\\" hypothesis. To elucidate the host airway interaction with viruses leading to exacerbations, we thus focus our review on recent findings of viral interaction with the upper airway. We compiled how viral induced changes to the upper airway may contribute to chronic airway inflammatory disease exacerbations, to provide a unified elucidation of the potential exacerbation mechanisms initiated from predominantly upper airway infections. Despite being a major cause of exacerbation, reports linking respiratory viruses to acute exacerbations only start to emerge in the late 1950s (Pattemore et al., 1992) ; with bacterial infections previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation (Stevens, 1953; Message and Johnston, 2002) . However, with the advent of PCR technology, more viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s (Message and Johnston, 2002) . Rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the predominant viruses linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Jartti and Gern, 2017) . Other viruses such as parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV) and adenovirus (AdV) have also been implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent (Johnston et al., 2005; Oliver et al., 2014; Ko et al., 2019) . More recently, other viruses including bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), certain coronavirus (CoV) strains, a specific enterovirus (EV) strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been reported as contributing to acute exacerbations . The common feature these viruses share is that they can infect both the upper and/or lower airway, further increasing the inflammatory conditions in the diseased airway (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Britto et al., 2017) . Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche (Busse et al., 2010) . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection (Vareille et al., 2011; Braciale et al., 2012) . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole (Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . Furthermore, due to the different replication cycles and response against the myriad of respiratory viruses, each respiratory virus may also contribute to exacerbations via different mechanisms that may alter their severity. Hence, this review will focus on compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases; as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease. The review will serve to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation. Such an approach may be clinically significant due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viral-induced exacerbations. This will improve the quality of life of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Once the link between viral infection and acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory disease was established, there have been many reports on the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation induced by respiratory viral infection. Upon infecting the host, viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection. Generally, infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFNα/β) and type III (IFNλ) interferons, cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Matsukura et al., 2013) . These, in turn, enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) . These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases. Additionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP), viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2015; Dunican and Fahy, 2015) . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases (Wang et al., 2009; Tacon et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . An epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) has also recently been identified (Nagarkar et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2018; Allinne et al., 2019) . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier (Gabryelska et al., 2019; Roan et al., 2019) . ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated (Scanlon and McKenzie, 2012; Li and Hendriks, 2013) . In the event of viral infection, cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier will also induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway (Allakhverdi et al., 2007; Goldsmith et al., 2012; Byers et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2013; Beale et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014; Uller and Persson, 2018; Ravanetti et al., 2019) . These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation (Camelo et al., 2017) . In the case of COPD, increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation (Silver et al., 2016) . Interestingly, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 . As integration of the virology, microbiology and immunology of viral infection becomes more interlinked, additional factors and FIGURE 1 | Current understanding of viral induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Upon virus infection in the airway, antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway.

(2006) has underlined the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents in causing more severe acute exacerbations in the airway.Question: Why do treatment and management vary in efficacy?","answer":"due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  A new sub-1-V CMOS bandgap voltage reference without using low-threshold-voltage device is presented in this paper. The new proposed sub-1-V bandgap reference with startup circuit has been successfully verified in a standard 0.25-μm CMOS process, where the occupied silicon area is only 177 μm x 106 μm. The experimental results have shown that, with the minimum supply voltage of 0.85 V, the output reference voltage is 238.2 mV at room temperature, and the temperature coefficient is 58.1 ppm/°C from-10°C to 120°C without laser trimming. Under the supply voltage of 0.85 V, the average power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) is -33.2 dB at 10kHz.Literature Review:","answer":"Neuteboom et al.  , propose the BVR circuit illustrated in Fig. 4 , which is based on the resistive division technique and provide an output voltage lower than the bandgap voltage of the silicon. The BVR circuit makes use of three vertical PNP transistors with emitter ratio of N. The opamp controls the emitter current and maintains a DV EB across the resistor R 1 in the PTAT current generation loop. Operation under low supply voltage operation condition is Fig. 3 Bandgap voltage reference using a transimpedance amplifier proposed by Jiang et al.  achieved by connecting the resistor R 3 across the bandgap reference, and the resulting output voltage becomes a fraction of the bandgap voltage which is given by In this BVR circuit, two currents that are proportional to voltages at nodes a and b are generated. The opamp is used to force the two voltages V a and V b to be equal thus producing a current in the nominally equal resistors R 2A and R 2B proportional to V EB . As a result the current in the PMOS transistors M 1 , M 2 and M 3 (I 1 = I 2 = I 3 ) is given by and the output voltage is then given by Eq. 10, where N is the emitter area ratio of the two diode connected bipolar transistors Q 1 and Q 2 . The theoretical minimum supply voltage for this circuit architecture is V DDðminÞ ¼ V EB þ V thp . The compensation of the temperature coefficients of the thermal voltage V T and V EB is achieved by choosing the values of N and of the R 2A /R 1 ratio which satisfy For proper sub 1 V operation, the authors proposed an opamp circuit based on native MOS transistors which are not always available in standard digital CMOS technology process. Moreover, these BVR circuits require the usage of parasitic vertical PNP transistors included in CMOS process, but which are not very well characterized. The vertical PNP transistors are process dependent and offer limited robustness to process variation as the doping gradient, process parameters vary a lot within transistors of the same die. Some design advantages, such as enhanced insensitivity to ripple in the power supply and/or better power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) performance could be obtained using cascode devices in the current mirror but at the expense of an increased of the minimum power supply. The opamp used in BVR circuits are required to be fully operational under sub 1 V condition. Since the output node drives p-channel current sources, and considering that |V th ,p| = 0.7, the output quiescent voltage should be maintained to be around 0.15-0.2 V in order to maintain the PMOS transistors current mirror in strong inversion. Moreover, their input common mode voltage should be maintained at value at least equal to one emitter-base voltage of 0.65 V, even though the emitter-based voltage of BJT decreases to value around 0.45 V when the temperature is increased up to 100°C. Similar BVR core circuit has been proposed by Malcovati et al. BIB001 , and is depicted in Fig. 6 . The later enables designers to overcome the limitation of the low input common mode voltage requirement for the opamp and enhance the implementation of a sub 1 V BVR circuit by using the BiCMOS process technology. The proposed BVR circuit has two stable operating points and requires a start-up circuit to prevent operation in the undesired operation point. In addition, the circuit compensates for first order temperature dependence only as outlined in Eq. 12. The V BE of a BJT does not change linearly with temperature but according to the relationship given by where g depends on the bipolar structure and is around 4, while a equals 1 if the current in the BJT is PTAT and goes to 0 when the current is temperature independent. The current in the PMOS transistors of the bandgap circuit is copied by using transistor M 12 and injected into a diode connected BJT transistor Q 3 . A V BE with a = 0 is produced across Q 3 . The difference between V BE;Q 3 ðTÞ and V BE;Q 1;2 ðTÞ leads to a voltage proportional to the nonlinear term of Eq. 12 The opamp input stage is based on two grounded PNP transistors as shown in Fig. 7 . The bias current in the differential pair of the opamp is a replica of the current in the diode connected BJT of the bandgap structure, since transistor Q 1 of the bandgap and Q 3 of the input stage of the opamp form a current mirror. This enables the designer to overcome the need of having current source in the input stage of the differential amplifier that required at least one saturation voltage to operate properly. The current signal generated by the input differential pair Q 3 -Q 4 is folded and collected by diodes connected MOS transistors (M 6 and M 7 ). The resulting differential gain becomes where the suffix BJT refers to the input BJT and the suffix MOS refers to the diode loads M 6 and M 7 . Using I BJT = 4 I MOS the gain obtained is 8 while having a fully symmetrical input and a practically zero systematic offset. The second stage is only a push-pull circuit. Curvature compensation is achieved by subtracting, from both I 1 and I 2 , a current proportional to V NL . This is obtained by adding nominally equal resistors R 4 and R 5 , which drain from M 1 and M 2 the required current (I NL ) as shown in Fig. 6 , and leading to output voltage of The proposed BVR architecture achieves an output voltage of 0.536 V with a temperature coefficient of 7.5 ppm/K when the temperature changes from 0°C to 80°C, and a voltage supply coefficient of 212 ppm/V. Ker et al. BIB002 , proposed a BVR circuit that provide a fraction of the bandgap voltage by mean of resistive division to reduce the input common mode voltage requirement of the opamp, without using low threshold devices as illustrated on Fig. 8 . The proposed BVR circuit also exploits the alternate connection technique of the opamp input stage by connecting it to nodes V 1 and V 2 instead of nodes a and b as was done in previous works. We should recall that the main idea presented by Leung et al. and Ker et al., being to provide alternate connection points of the BIB002 opamp input stage. The proposed BVR circuit generates an output voltage of 0.238 V with a temperature coefficient of 58.1 ppm/°C, and the minimum supply voltage is 0.85 V."},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

The Isomorphic Grammars approach to MT involves developing the grammars of the Source and Target languages in parallel, in order to ensure that SL and TL expressions which stand in the translation relation have isomorphic derivations. The principle advantage of this approach is that knowledge concerning translation equivalence of expressions may be directly exploited, obviating the need for answers to semantic questions that we do not yet have. Semantic and other information may still be incorporated, but as constraints on the translation relation, not as levels of textual representation.

Licofelone, a dual anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, may have a better cardiovascular profile that cycloxygenase-2 inhibitors due to cycloxygenase-1 blockade-mediated antithrombotic effect and a better gastrointestinal tolerability. We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of licofelone on atherosclerotic lesions as well as in isolated neutrophils from whole blood of rabbits compared with a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib. We also assessed the antithrombotic effect of licofelone in rabbit platelet-rich plasma. For this purpose, 30 rabbits underwent injury of femoral arteries, and they were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day licofelone or 5 mg/kg/day rofecoxib or no treatment during 4 weeks with atherogenic diet in all cases. Ten healthy rabbits were used as controls. Neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood of rabbits for ex vivo studies. Licofelone reduced intima/media ratio in injured arteries, the macrophages infiltration in the neointimal area, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in rabbit atheroma. Moreover, licofelone inhibited COX-2 and 5-LOX protein expression in vascular lesions. Rofecoxib only diminished COX-2 protein expression and MCP-1 gene expression in vascular atheroma. Prostaglandin E (2) in rabbit plasma was attenuated by both drugs. Licofelone almost abolished 5-LOX activity by inhibiting leukotriene B4 generation in rabbit neutrophils and prevented platelet thromboxane B2 production from whole blood. Licofelone reduces neointimal formation and inflammation in an atherosclerotic rabbit model more markedly than rofecoxib. This effect, together with the antiplatelet activity of licofelone, suggests that this drug may have a favorable cardiovascular profile.","answer":"[[\\"leukotriene B4\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"5-LOX\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"COX\\"], [\\"rofecoxib\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"monocyte chemoattractant protein-1\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"LOX\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"5-lipoxygenase\\"], [\\"Rofecoxib\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"licofelone\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"Rofecoxib\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"MCP-1\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"MCP-1\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"cycloxygenase-1\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"nuclear factor-kappaB\\"], [\\"licofelone\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"5-LOX\\"], [\\"thromboxane B2\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"5-LOX\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"cyclooxygenase\\"], [\\"Licofelone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"5-LOX\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Through allosteric and covalent modification sites on its α, β and δ (endogenous calmodulin) regulatory subunits, PhK integrates neural (Ca2+), hormonal (cAMP and Ca2+) and metabolic (ADP) signals, resulting in large increases in the activity of its catalytic γ subunit and the tight control of glycogenolysis and subsequent energy production. Despite being the first protein kinase to be discovered, little is known about the structure of the PhK complex. High resolution crystal structures are available only for the catalytic domain of the γ subunit and, of course, calmodulin, the δ subunit; but together, these account for only 15% of PhK's mass. Virtually nothing is known about the structures of PhK's large regulatory α (138.4 kDa) and β subunits (125.2 kDa), which account for 81% of its mass.</p><p>The α and β subunits are homologous and are generally considered to be products of an early gene duplication event (2); however, they do posses distinct regions near their N- and C-termini that are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or autophosphorylated by the γ subunit within the complex (1). Aside from each other, the intact full-length α and β subunits have no apparent homologs found in current data bases, although bioinformatics approaches indicate that both subunits do contain domains with structural similarities to known enzymes. Using several bioinformatics approaches, Carrière et al. (3) predicted that α and β each contain four distinct domains (A, B, C and D), and that the C-terminal D domains of these subunits are related to calcinuerin B proteins. Domain A was argued to have significant similarities with the α/β barrel glucoamylase GH15 family of proteins, in agreement with an earlier prediction for this domain by Pallen (4).</p><p>Callebaut and coworkers carried out 3D modeling of the GH15-like domains of α and β using as a template the crystal structure of the Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum glucoamylase GH15 domain complexed with acarbose (5), a pseudotetrasccharide transition state analog inhibitor of α-glucosidases (6,7). Comparison of the active site structure of GH15 with the predicted GH15-like domain of α showed that almost all the residues that contact acarbose in GH15 are conserved in α, including the catalytic glutamate residues involved in hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of the polysaccharide (5). Analysis of the β subunit's GH15-like domain indicated only partial conservation of the residues involved in ligand contacts and catalysis in GH15. In the same study, it was demonstrated that many mutations in the α subunit known to cause X-linked liver glycogenoses map directly within the GH15-like glycoside binding site, suggesting an important functional role for this domain. As a first step in determining the validity of the predictions of glucoamylase-like domains in PhK's α and β subunits, we determined whether PhK was directly affected by acarbose. We show herein that acarbose binds to PhK with relatively high affinity, and that in doing so, it perturbs the structure of the kinase and brings about its activation.</p><p>Substrate-induced changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum glucoamylase have been used successfully to monitor the binding of a series of malto-oligosaccharide substrates (8). In the glucoamylase active site, both maltose and acarbose form contacts with, or are proximal to, four tryptophan residues (6), several of which are conserved among the GH15 family of enzymes and the GH15-like domains of the PhK α and β subunits (5). To determine whether PhK behaves similarly to glucoamylase, the concentration-dependent binding of acarbose by PhK was followed by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of the complex at both pH 6.8 (nonactivating for PhK) and pH 8.2 (activating). Plots of the differences in relative fluorescence measured for the kinase in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of acarbose were hyperbolic (Fig. 1), and fitted by non-linear least square methods (described under Supporting Information). Apparent KD values calculated for binding of the oligosaccharide were nearly equivalent, 3.7μM (pH 6.8) and 5.6 μM (pH 8.2), indicating that nonactivated and pH-activated forms of PhK have similar affinities for acarbose.</p><p>We next examined whether acarbose influences the catalytic activity of PhK. Activity measurements were performed using as substrate a well-characterized synthetic tetradecapeptide corresponding to the phosphorylatable N-terminus of glycogen phosphorylase, the natural substrate of PhK. Phosphorylase was not used as substrate to avoid the possibility of acarbose binding to its glycogen storage site and altering its ability to serve as a substrate for PhK, thus only indirectly influencing PhK's activity. With three different preparations of PhK, we found that 250 μM acarbose increased the rate of phosphorylation of the peptide by 2- to 3-fold at pH 6.8 (Figure S1 of Supporting Information).</p><p>An alternative activity assay to measure the effect of acarbose is autophosphorylation of PhK's α and β subunits; however, even though any effect of acarbose would by definition be directly on PhK, the acarbose could theoretically affect the catalytic activity of the γ subunit, or the ability of the α and/or β subunits to serve as substrates, or a combination of both. The extent of autophosphorylation of PhK's α and β subunits ± 250 μM acarbose was followed over time at pH 6.8 and 8.2. At the lower pH value, acarbose stimulated phosphorylation of α by 3-fold (Fig. 2A) and β by nearly 2-fold (Fig. 2C), similar to its stimulation of synthetic peptide phosphorylation at this pH value. As expected, the stimulation by acarbose at pH 8.2 was considerably less and was similar for both subunits (1.2-fold; Figs. 2B&D).</p><p>To test for acarbose-induced changes in PhK's α and β subunits, we used chemical crosslinkers as conformational probes, specifically employing crosslinkers known to be selective for those subunits. No changes in cross-linking were observed for crosslinkers that primarily form α-conjugates (9,10); however, acarbose perturbed crosslinking of PhK by N-[γ-maleimidobutyryloxy] succinimide ester (GMBS), an affinity-based crosslinker that selectively targets β and γ subunits in the (αβγδ)4 complex (11). The composition of all conjugates was determined by their apparent mass and cross reactivity against anti-α, anti-β and anti-γ subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Fig. 3B), as previously described (12,13); no conjugates containing the intrinsic calmodulin subunit (δ) were detected in Western blots using an anti-calmodulin mAb (data not shown). In the absence of acarbose, GMBS formed small amounts of a βγγ heterotrimer (massExp = 213 kDa: 0.74% error), as well as a large conjugate with an apparent mass exceeding 300 kDa and containing α, β and γ subunits (Fig. 3, lanes 2). Acarbose (100 μM) dramtically increased the formation of both complexes, as well as promoting the formation of two new species: βγγi (massExp = 210 kDa: 2.1% error) and βi (massExp = 118 kDa: 5.7 % error) (Fig. 3, lanes 3). These two new species undoubtedly represent intrasubunit crosslinked forms of βγγ and β.</p><p>The sum of the data in this study clearly demonstrates that PhK binds acarbose with relatively high affinity and that this oligosaccharide perturbs the structure of the PhK complex and activates it, providing the first experimental evidence supporting the existence of the predicted glucoamylase-like domains in PhK's large regulatory α and β subunits (3-5). It is unclear from this study which subunit, or subunits, bind the acarbose. The autophosphorylation of both is stimulated, and even though the crosslinking of the β subunit is altered, this could be through an indirect effect, as the α and β subunits are most certainly structurally coupled in the complex (14). The activation by saturating acarbose is less than that observed with other allosteric activators of PhK, which may be related to the inability of acarbose to enhance formation of α-γ conjugates with a variety of crosslinkers, a property routinely observed with other activators (15). Although acarbose is most similar to glycogen, activation by the latter is poorly characterized, including the subunit(s) to which it binds. It remains to be determined whether the predicted glucoamylase-like domains supported by the work herein are catalytic, and if so, whether this potential second function of PhK is affected by its state of activation. Our results demonstrate that acarbose will be a valuable tool, however, in evaluating this proposed new function.</p>","answer":"Phosphorylase kinase (PhK), an (xcexb1xcexb2xcexb3xcexb4)4 complex, stimulates energy production from glycogen in the cascade activation of glycogenolysis.

Both subunits are thought to be multi-domain structures, and recent predictions based on their sequences suggest the presence of potentially functional glucoamylase (GH15)-like domains near their amino-termini.

Westructure the agent into multiple sub-agents, which are trained on disjoint subsets of the training data. Sub-agentsare co-ordinated by a meta-agent, called aggregator, that groups and scores answers from the sub-agents for each given input. Unlike sub-agents, the aggregator is a generalist since it learns a policy for the entire training set. We argue that itis easier to train multiple sub-agents than a single generalist one since each sub-agent only needs to learn a policy that performs well for a subset of examples. Moreover, specializingagents on different partitions of the data encourages them to learn distinct policies, thus giving the aggregator the possibility to see answers from a population of diverse agents. Learning a single policythat results in an equally diverse strategy is more challenging. Since each sub-agent istrained on a fraction of the data, and there is no communication between them, training can be done faster than training a single agent on the full data. Additionally, it is easierto parallelize than applying existing distributed algorithms such as asynchronous SGD or A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) , as the sub-agents do not need to exchange weights or gradients. After training the sub-agents, only their actions need to be sent to the aggregator.We build upon the works of Nogueira & Cho (2017) and Buck et al. (2018b) . Hence, we evaluate our methodon the same tasks: query reformulation for document retrieval and question-answering. We show that it outperforms astrong baseline of an ensemble of agents trained on the full dataset. We also found that performanceand reformulation diversity are correlated (Sec. 5.5). Our main contributions are thefollowing:• A simple method to achieve more diverse strategies and better generalization performance than a model average ensemble.• Training can be easily parallelizedin the proposed method.• An interesting finding that contradictsour, perhaps naive, intuition: specializing agents on semantically similar data does not work as well as random partitioning. An explanation is given in Appendix F.• Wereport new state-of-the art results onseveral datasets using BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) .However results improve marginally using reinforcementlearning and on the question answering task we see no improvements.3 A query is the title of a paper and the ground-truth answer consists of the papers cited within.Each document in the corpus consists of its title and abstract.We proposed a method to build a better query reformulation system by training multiple sub-agents on partitions of the data using reinforcement learning and an aggregator that learns to combine the answers of the multiple agents given a new query.We showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on the tasks of document retrieval and question answering.We also found that a first attempt based on semantic clustering did not produce good results, and that diversity was an important but hard to characterize reason for improved performance.One interesting orthogonal extension would be to introduce diversity on the beam search decoder BID11 Li et al., 2016) , thus shedding light on the question of whether the gains come from the increased capacity of the system due to the use of the multiple agents, the diversity of reformulations, or both.Furthermore, we found that reinforcement learning for the reformulation task is hard when the underlying system already performs extremely well on the task.This might be due to the tasks being too constrained (which makes it possible for machines to almost reach human performance), and requires further exploration.AGGREGATOR: The encoder f q0 is a word-level two-layer CNN with filter sizes of 9 and 3, respectively, and 128 and 256 kernels, respectively.D = 512.No dropout is used.ADAM is the optimizer with learning rate of 10 −4 and mini-batch of size 64.It is trained for 100 epochs.","answer":"We use reinforcement learning for query reformulation on two tasks and surprisingly find that when training multiple agents diversity of the reformulations is more important than specialisation."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder secondary to a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Several mutations in the PAH gene have recently been reported, and linkage disequilibrium was observed between RFLP haplotypes and specific mutations. A new molecular lesion has been identified in exon 7 of the PAH gene in a Hungarian PKU patient by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA. The C-to-T transition causes the substitution of Arg243 to a termination codon, and the mutant allele is associated with haplotype 4 of the PAH gene. The mutation is present in two of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among Eastern Europeans and is not present among Western Europeans and Asians. The rarity of this mutant allele and its restricted geographic distribution suggest that the mutational event occurred recently on a normal haplotype 4 background in Eastern Europe..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"molecular lesion\\", \\"deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase\\", \\"Phenylketonuria\\", \\"PKU\\", \\"genetic disorder\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

UAC occlusion occurred in 2 of 15 patients in the heparin group and in 11 of 15 patients in the control group (p = 0.001). Using life-table analysis, the functional life span of UAC was estimated. On day 8, 100% of UACs in heparin group and 9% of UACs in control group were patent (p < 0.05). Coagulation profile remained unaltered after addition of heparin compared with that before the start of the therapy. There was no difference in the incidence of subependymal intraventricular hemorrhage between the two groups. It is concluded that heparin in such low concentration is effective in prolonging duration of UAC patency without causing adverse effects.Title 3:Effect of heparinization of fluids infused through an umbilical artery catheter on catheter patency and frequency of complications.Abstract 3:Heparinization of fluids (1 unit/ml) infused through an umbilical artery catheter (UAC) was efficacious in prolonging catheter patency in a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study. On the basis of life-table analysis, the half-life of catheter function was seven days in the heparinized group as compared with just over two days in the nonheparinized group (P less than .01). UAC occlusion occurred in 4 of 32 patients in the heparinized and 19 of 30 in the nonheparinized group (chi 2 = 17.6, P less than .01). Blood transfusions, number of arterial blood gases drawn through the UACs, and fluid infusion rates were not related to catheter occlusion. Heparinization of the UAC infusion did not alter the partial thromboplastin time or the incidence of catheter-related thromboembolic phenomena in the extremities. Heparinization of fluids infused through a UAC appears to be useful in the care of critically ill neonates.Title 4:Effect of heparin infusates in umbilical arterial catheters on frequency of thrombotic complications.Abstract 4:We studied 111 infants requiring an umbilical artery catheter, 59 with heparin and 52 without. Thirty-four thrombi were detected, 16 in the heparin group and 18 in the control group. The numbers of thrombi in the two groups was not significantly different, but the number of clotted or nonfunctioning umbilical artery catheters was greater in the control group (P less than 0.05), as was the incidence of hypertension (P less than 0.05). There were no other significant differences between the two groups. We conclude that the use of low doses of heparin may not change the incidence of umbilical artery catheter-related thrombi, but it does appear to lower the incidence of their sequelae.Title 5:Heparin and the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants.Abstract 5:This study was carried out to determine whether the routine use of low-dose heparin in umbilical catheter infusates increases the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage or alters the coagulation profile in premature infants.                In a randomized, blinded trial, 113 infants born at less than 31 weeks' gestation were assigned to receive, in their umbilical catheter infusate, either 1 unit of heparin per milliliter (n = 55) or no heparin (n = 58). Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III activity levels were determined at the start and the completion of the study. Cranial ultrasonography was performed during the first week of life.                There was no difference in the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage between the heparin and no heparin groups, 35.8% and 31.5%, respectively (p = 0.6). Similarly, no difference was detected in the incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III/IV). Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen levels were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the use of heparin was associated with a lower antithrombin III activity level. Antenatal indomethacin use was associated with a 2.9 increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 7.17).                A low dose of heparin added to umbilical catheter infusates does not increase the incidence or severity of intraventricular hemorrhage or significantly alter the coagulation profile in premature infants.Title 6:Prevention of umbilical artery catheter clots with heparinized infusates.Abstract 6:49 neonates requiring umbilical artery catheters (UACs) were randomly assigned to receive standard or heparin-containing infusates. 3 of 23 (13%) of the patients receiving heparin had catheters removed because they became functionally occluded compared to 15 of 26 (58%) in the control group (p less than 0.005). 4 of 13 (31%) single injection aortograms obtained in control infants demonstrated thrombi, compared to none of 7 in the heparin group. 1 patient in the heparin group had an aortic clot demonstrated at post-mortum examination. There were neither clinical coagulopathies nor abnormalities of partial thromboplastin time attributable to the administration of heparinized fluids. Heparinization of UAC infusates appears to be a safe method of reducing the risk of catheter occlusion. Heparin effect on large vessel clot risk remains unproven.","answer":"Heparinization of the fluid infused through an umbilical arterial catheter decreases the likelihood of umbilical arterial catheters occluding. The lowest concentration tested so far (0.25 units/mL) has been shown to be effective. Heparinization of flushes without heparinizing the infusate is ineffective. The frequency of aortic thrombosis has not been shown to be affected; however, the confidence intervals for this effect are very wide. The frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage has not been shown to be affected by heparinization of the infusate, but again the confidence intervals are very wide and even a major increase in the incidence of grade 3 and 4 intraventricular hemorrhage would not have been detected."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

In 1992 we described a new syndrome consisting of syncopal episodes and/or sudden death in patients with a structurally normal heart and a characteristic electrocardiogram displaying a pattern resembling right bundle branch block with an ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3. In 1998 it was described that the disease is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. Three different mutations have been identified. All three mutations affect the structure and the function of the sodium channel SCN5A. Two mutations result in total loss of function of the sodium channel. The other mutation results in acceleration of the recovery of the sodium channel from inactivation. The disease causes 4 to 10 sudden deaths per 10,000 inhabitants per year in areas like Thailand and Laos. Up to 50% of the yearly sudden deaths in patients with a normal heart might be caused by this syndrome. The diagnosis is easily made by means of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The presence of concealed and intermittent forms, however, makes the diagnosis difficult in some patients. The ECG can be modulated by changes in autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. Beta-adrenergic stimulation normalises the ECG, while i.v. ajmaline, flecainide or procainamide accentuate the ST segment elevation and are capable of unmasking concealed and intermittent forms of the disease. The prognosis is poor for patients who do not receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Antiarrhythmic drugs like amiodarone or beta-blockers do not prevent sudden death in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

RABV was recently modified by Wickersham and colleagues such that it can travel across only one synapse, allowing for a straightforward definition of monosynaptic connections (Wickersham et al., 2007b) . This strategy permitted the first unambiguous identification of retrogradely connected cells from an initially infected cell (\\"starter cell\\"), without the need for electrophysiology. Moreover, the starter cell could be defined through the expression of a specific viral receptor that limited the initial infection. Recently, we created an anterograde monosynaptic virus that complements the previously available retrograde viral tracers (Beier et al., 2011) . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus related to RABV, with its own glycoprotein (G) gene (VSV-G), or with a G from the unrelated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-G), spreads in the anterograde direction across synapses. VSV can be used as a polysynaptic tracer that spreads across many synapses, owing to the fact that the normal, replicationcompetent form of the virus does not cause serious diseases in humans (Brandly and Hanson, 1957; Johnson et al., 1966; Brody et al., 1967) . Whether the virus is a monosynaptic or polysynaptic tracer is determined by the method of delivery of the G gene ( Figure 1A) . Advantages of VSV are that it is well-characterized, is relatively simple in comparison to PRV, and it rapidly grows to high titer in tissue culture cells. It is also being developed as a vaccine vector, often using a G of another virus as the immunogen, as well as being developed as a cytocidal agent that will target tumor cells in humans (Balachandran and Barber, 2000; Stojdl et al., 2000 Stojdl et al., , 2003 . Previous studies of the anatomical patterns of transmission, as well as physiological recordings, have shown that the transmission of VSV and RABV among neurons is via synapses (Kelly and Strick, 2000; Wickersham et al., 2007b; Beier et al., 2011) . In addition, it has been shown that RABV, as well as lentiviruses with RABV-G in their envelope, travel retrogradely from an injection site (Mazarakis et al., 2001; Wickersham et al., 2007a) . We hypothesized that providing a recombinant VSV (rVSV) with the RABV-G would create a retrograde polysynaptic transsynaptic tracer without the biosafety concerns inherent to RABV. Our initial characterization of rVSV with RABV-G showed that indeed FIGURE 1 | Synaptic tracing strategies using VSV. (A) Schematic illustrating the strategies for polysynaptic or monosynaptic retrograde or anterograde transsynaptic transmission of rVSV encoding GFP. The initially infected cell is indicated by an asterisk. VSV encoding a glycoprotein (G) within its genome can spread polysynaptically. The direction of the spread depends on the identity of the glycoprotein. Infected neurons are shown in green. In some cases, the initially infected starter cell can be defined by the expression of an avian receptor, TVA (tagged with a red fluorescent protein). The TVA-expressing neurons can then be specifically infected by rVSV G with the EnvA/RABV-G (A/RG) glycoprotein (Wickersham et al., 2007b) on the virion surface [rVSV G(A/RG)]. These starter cells are then yellow, due to viral GFP and mCherry from TVA-mCherry expression. For monosynaptic tracing, the G protein is expressed in trans in the TVA-expressing cell, and thus complements rVSV G to allow transmission in a specific direction. (B) Genomic diagrams of rVSV vectors. All VSVs contain four essential proteins: N, P, M, and L. Some viruses encode a G gene in their genome, which allows them to spread polysynaptically. rVSV vectors typically encode a transgene in the first position, while others carry an additional transgene in the G position.

Scale bars = 50 µm. www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 11 | 2 it could be taken up as a retrograde tracer (Beier et al., 2011) . To determine if it could transmit among neurons following its replication in neurons, and to further analyze the transmission patterns of both the monosynaptic and polysynaptic forms of rVSV with RABV-G, we made injections into several CNS and peripheral locations. In addition, we performed co-infections of rVSV with RABV-G and the anterograde form of rVSV in order to exploit the differences in the directionality of transmission of these two viruses in mapping circuits. Schematics of viruses created and used throughout this study are shown in Figure 1 . We created rVSV vector plasmids carrying different transgenes in either the first or fifth genomic positions ( Figure 1B) . After rescuing each virus, we tested the ability of each to express transgenes in different brain regions through intracranial injections ( Figure 1C ). All rVSV vectors drove robust fluorophore expression 1 or 2 days post-infection (hpi) ( Figure 1C ) (van den Pol et al., 2009) . In fact, by 12 hpi, labeling was sufficiently bright to image fine morphological details, such as dendritic spines ( Figure 1C ,iv). To characterize the physiological properties of cells infected with rVSV, we tested a replication-competent rVSV encoding GFP, with RABV-G in the genome in place of VSV-G [hereafter designated rVSV(RABV-G)]. van den Pol et al. reported that hippocampal neurons infected with replication-incompetent (G-deleted or \\" G\\") rVSV were physiologically healthy at 12-14 hpi, but were less so by 1 day post-infection (dpi) (van den Pol et al., 2009) . Given the known toxicity of both VSV and RABV-G (Coulon et al., 1982) , we tested the physiology of cortical pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex (M1) infected with rVSV(RABV-G). Between 12 and 18 hpi, the membrane capacitance, input resistance, resting membrane potential, and current-to-action potential firing relationship were indistinguishable between infected and uninfected neurons (Figure 2) . However, by 2 dpi, electrophysiological properties were so abnormal in the infected cortical pyramidal cells that physiological measurements could not be made. The speed and strength of the expression of transgenes encoded by VSV depends upon the gene's genomic position (van den Pol et al., 2009; Beier et al., 2011) . Genes in the first position are expressed the most highly, with a decrease in the level of expression in positions more 3 within the viral plus strand. When GFP was inserted into the first position of VSV, GFP fluorescence was first detectable at approximately 1 hpi in cultured cells (van den Pol et al., 2009) . In order to quantify the relative expression of a fluorescent protein in the first genomic position in neurons, rat hippocampal slices were infected with a replication-incompetent rVSV that expresses mCherry (rVSV G, Figures 1A,B) . This was a G virus which had the RABV-G supplied in trans during the preparation of the virus stock [referred to as rVSV G(RABV-G)]. Average fluorescence intensity of the infected cells was measured every hour over the course of 18 h. By 4 hpi at 37 • C, red fluorescence was clearly visible, and reached maximal levels by approximately 14 hpi (N = 3, Figure 3 ). Similar results were obtained with a virus encoding GFP in the first genomic position rather than mCherry (i.e., Figure 1B ) (N = 3). We previously demonstrated that rVSV(RABV-G) could be taken up retrogradely by neurons (Beier et al., 2011) , but these experiments did not distinguish between direct axonal uptake of the initial inoculum vs. retrograde transsynaptic transmission following viral replication. To distinguish between these two mechanisms and to extend the previous analyses, we conducted further experiments in the mammalian visual system (Figures 4A-G) . As visual cortex area 1 (V1) does not receive direct projections from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but rather receives secondary input from RGCs via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), infection of RGCs from injection of V1 would demonstrate retrograde transmission from cells which supported at least one round of viral replication. Following a V1 injection with rVSV(RABV-G), GFP-positive RGCs were observed in the retina by 3 dpi (N = 3; Figure 4G ). Importantly, viral labeling in the brain was restricted to primary and secondary projection areas, even at 7 dpi. These included the LGN ( Figure 4D ) and the hypothalamus (Figure 4E) , two areas known to project directly to V1 (Kandel, 2000) . Selective labeling was observed in other areas, such as cortical areas surrounding V1 (Figure 4C) , which project directly to V1, and also in the superior colliculus (SC) stratum griseum centrale, which projects to the LGN ( Figure 4F) . Labeling was also observed in the nucleus basalis, which projects to the cortex, as well as many components of the basal ganglia circuit, which provide input to the thalamus [such as the caudate-putamen (CP), globus pallidus (GP), and the subthalamic nucleus (STn)]. The amygdala, which projects to the hypothalamus, was also labeled. Consistent with a lack of widespread viral transmission, animals did not exhibit signs of disease at 7 dpi. These data show that rVSV(RABV-G) can spread in a retrograde direction from the injection site, but do not address whether the virus can spread exclusively in the retrograde direction. Directional transsynaptic specificity can only be definitively addressed using a unidirectional circuit. We therefore turned to the primary motor cortex (M1) to CP connection, in which neurons project from the cortex to the CP, but not in the other direction ( Figure 4H ) (Beier et al., 2011) . Injections of rVSV(RABV-G) into M1 should not label neurons in the CP if the virus can only label cells across synapses in the retrograde direction. Indeed, at 2 dpi, areas directly projecting to the injection site, including the contralateral cortex, were labeled ( Figure 4I ). Only axons from cortical cells were observed in the CP, with no GFP-labeled cell bodies present in the CP (Figure 4J) , consistent with lack of anterograde transsynaptic spread. By 3 dpi, a small number of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the CP were observed, likely via secondary spread from initially infected thalamic or GP neurons (data not shown). A particular advantage of retrograde viral tracers is the ability to label CNS neurons projecting to peripheral sites. This has been a powerful application of both RABV and PRV (Ugolini et al., 1989; Standish et al., 1994) . To test if rVSV(RABV-G) could also perform this function, we examined the innervation of the dura surface by neurons of the trigeminal ganglion, a neuronal circuit thought to be involved in migraine headaches (Penfield and McNaughton, 1940; Mayberg et al., 1984) . These neurons have axons, but not canonical dendrites, and send projections into the spinal cord and brainstem. Therefore, the only way trigeminal neurons could become labeled from viral application to the dura is through retrograde uptake of the virus. We applied rVSV(RABV-G) to the intact dura mater and analyzed the dura, trigeminal ganglion, and CNS for labeling ( Figure 4K ). At the earliest time point examined, 3 dpi, we observed axons traveling along the dura, but little other evidence of infection ( Figure 4L) . No labeled neuronal cell bodies on the dura were observed, consistent with the lack of neurons on this surface. In contrast, we did find labeled cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion ( Figure 4M ). No infection was seen in the CNS, even at 4 dpi, consistent with the lack of inputs from the brain into the trigeminal ganglion (N = 4 animals). To further characterize patterns and kinetics of viral transmission and directional specificity of transsynaptic spread, injections of rVSV(RABV-G) were made into the CP ( Figure 5A ). In order to determine which cells were labeled by direct uptake of virus in the inoculum, a separate set of animals were injected into the CP with the replication-incompetent rVSV G(RABV-G) (N = 3 animals, analyzed 3 dpi). Cells labeled by rVSV G(RABV-G) were observed in the CP, GP, substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, and layers 3 and 5 of the cortex, consistent with infection at the axon terminal and retrograde labeling of cell bodies of neurons known to project directly to the CP ( Figure 5C ) (Albin et al., 1995) . Areas labeled by CP injection are indicated in Figure 5B . The patterns of spread for the replication-competent rVSV(RABV-G) were characterized over the course of 1-5 dpi ( Figures 5D-H) .Question: What virus are used by the most successful neuronal circuit tracing methods?","answer":"Pseudorabies (PRV) and Rabies viruses (RABV)"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: During the twentieth century, cases of acute febrile disease with renal compromise were described from several Eurasian countries and Japan, often in association with military engagements [15] . HFRS as a distinct syndrome, however, was first brought to the attention of western medicine in association with an outbreak that occurred among United Nations troops during the Korean conflict between 1951 and 1954, where more than 3,200 soldiers were afflicted [16] . It took more than two decades until the etiologic agent, Hantaan virus (HTNV), was isolated from the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius, detected in part by the binding of antibodies from patient serum samples to the lung tissues of healthy, wild-caught field mice [17, 18] . The virus was later found to represent the type species of a new genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae, although it was later apparent that the first hantavirus to be isolated was the shrew-borne Thottapalayam virus [19] . The categorization of hantaviruses as belonging to the family Bunyaviridae is due in part to the consistent presence of three RNA genomes that are circularized in vivo as a result of the presence of terminal complementary nucleotides that help fold the genome into a -hairpin‖ morphology, first described for the Uukuniemi phlebovirus [19, 20] . Table 1 is a list of the predominant, serologically distinct pathogenic hantaviruses. Many other named genotypes are described, but such other pathogenic forms are generally closely related to Andes or, in some cases, Sin Nombre virus. During virus maturation, the precursor form GPC is processed using a membrane -bound protease into Gn and Gc, a cleavage that occurs, and appears to be signaled, after the conserved peptide signal WAASA at the C-terminal of Gn [24] . Although the two proteins can be expressed independently through transfection, they can be retained in the wrong cellular compartment (ER or aggresome); they thus must be co-expressed to allow them stability so that the two can be assembled correctly in the Golgi [25, [27] [28] [29] . A number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins, including some features that are suspected to be involved in the pathogenicity of the disease-causing serotypes, a possibility that has engendered experimental attention. The glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor, or DAF [30, 31] ; with gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor [32] . Comparisons with the tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein, led Tischler et al. to consider the Gc glycoprotein as a potential class II fusion protein, perhaps imparting fusion activity to the virion, and this hypothesis has gained support in other studies [33, 34] . Additional activities have been identified with, or claimed to be related to, Gn. For many of these studies, an underlying premise has held that there are differences between the glycoproteins of -pathogenic‖ hantaviruses relative to viruses in the genus that are dubbed to be -non-pathogenic‖. While it is true that it has not yet been possible to link Prospect Hill virus (PHV) to human disease, the absence of evidence for its pathogenicity should perhaps not be equated with the evidence of its absence. One might only consider that the level of disease (e.g., lethargy, fever, proteinuria, and azotemia) associated with infection of nonhuman primates by PHV is not significantly different from that recorded for nonhuman primate models using the known-pathogen Puumala virus (PUUV) [35, 36] . For the purpose of this discussion we will presume that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic. While some studies have suggested that Gn glycoproteins are directed more rapidly into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway than are apathogenic forms, others have interpreted differences in the handling of Gn glycoproteins across hantavirus species by the ubiquitin-proteosomal system as independent of pathogenicity [37] [38] [39] . Some investigators have directed their efforts toward identifying a differential capacity, either kinetic or in absolute magnitude, in the ability of pathogenic and apathogenic hantaviruses to elicit an interferon response in cells. One premise that emerges is that apathogenic forms would tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would be quickly cleared or rendered less competent in its replication so as to blunt any pathological response in the host [40] [41] [42] . The anti-hantavirus innate response can in some cases be attributed to viral interaction as a ligand of TLR-3, but not in others, and in endothelial cells, it appears not to require more than the viral particle itself, even when introduced in replication-incompetent form [43, 44] . Proteins and mRNAs prominently induced by hantaviruses include MxA and IFIT-1 (ISG-56) and others including some with known or suspected anti-viral activity. Those hantaviruses, often highly pathogenic strains, that fail to induce a potent antiviral response, are suspected or presumed to have a (more) potent interferon-pathway antagonism mechanism relative to other viruses, a mechanism that acts positively to prevent an effective innate response from forming, at least early in infection [42, 45] . Yet some instances are reported wherein highly pathogenic hantaviruses, such as SNV, are also able to induce expression of interferon-stimulated gene mRNAs, even very early in infection, with ISG proteins, as expected, taking longer to appear in the cell [44] . Anti-interferon activities have also been attributed to the NSs protein that may be elaborated in cells infected by serotypes that encode this protein [46] . Other investigators have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans, such as vascular permeability changes. While early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing, hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating VEG-F-induced endothelial permeability [47, 48] . The shorter (50-kD) nucleocapsid or N protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid, along with the genomic viral RNA segments. As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity [49, 50] , it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm. It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein [51] , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix [52] . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that N has a wide variety of other activities, some of which can be linked, not only to fundamental requirements of replication, but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell. Thus, an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus N protein and the cellular protein Daxx has been proposed, with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences [51] . N is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments, and the SUMO-1 protein [53, 54] . Using reporter-gene based assays, Connie Schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that Hantaan virus' nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B). The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS [55] . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mRNAs [56] . N protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation, sometimes in previously unanticipated ways. It is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific -RNA chaperone‖, an activity that should facilitate the L polymerase's access to vRNA for transcription and replication, in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded RNA structures [57] . Some of N protein's effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature. It can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex, simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E, binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G, while replacing the helicase activity of eIF 4A, which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure [56, 58] . These three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. In P bodies, N protein's ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides, along with its activity in protecting capped RNAs from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by L polymerase (-cap snatching‖). Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi [27] . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments [52] . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), also known as vesicular-tubular cluster [52] . A dominant negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments [59] . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV [60] . Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression ( Table 2 ). The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate [61] . By the time symptoms appear in HCPS, both strong antiviral responses, and, for the more virulent viral genotypes, viral RNA can be detected in blood plasma or nucleated blood cells respectively [63, 64] . At least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS, suggesting that the replication of the virus plays an ongoing and real-time role in viral pathogenesis [65] [66] [67] . Several hallmark pathologic changes have been identified that occur in both HFRS and HCPS. A critical feature of both is a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS . The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma. The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections [62, 63] . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more severe forms of HFRS and HCPS have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce, through PAMP-PRR interactions and other means, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [64] . For HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet, for unknown reasons, spares the retroperitoneum and, in general, the kidney. In HFRS the situation is reversed, and yet it is often not appreciated that the expected preferential tissue tropism of HFRS-associated viruses and their HCPS-associated counterparts for the renal and pulmonary beds, respectively, is not as one would predict through the manifestations of the two diseases. Local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms, with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death. Yet it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS, but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome [64, 65] . It is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in HCPS, a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs. Thus, at least three classes of potential mechanisms, some overlapping and all certainly nonexclusive of the others, could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of HCPS. These include:(1) Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) with the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 [43] . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells [66] and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells [67] . (2) Direct viral effects. The observed correlation between viral load and disease severity leaves the possibility open that hantavirus particles or RNA can themselves have toxic effects on cells or on signaling.Question: What is a critical feature of both?","answer":"a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Huntington disease (HD) has been shown to be associated with an expanded CAG repeat within a novel gene on 4p16. 3 (IT15). A total of 30 of 1, 022 affected persons (2. 9% of our cohort) did not have an expanded CAG in the disease range. The reasons for not observing expansion in affected individuals are important for determining the sensitivity of using repeat length both for diagnosis of affected patients and for predictive testing programs and may have biological relevance for the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying HD. Here we show that the majority (18) of the individuals with normal sized alleles represent misdiagnosis, sample mix-up, or clerical error. The remaining 12 patients represent possible phenocopies for HD. In at least four cases, family studies of these phenocopies excluded 4p16. 3 as the region responsible for the phenotype. Mutations in the HD gene that are other than CAG expansion have not been excluded for the remaining eight cases; however, in as many as seven of these persons, retrospective review of these patients clinical features identified characteristics not typical for HD. This study shows that on rare occasions mutations in other, as-yet-undefined genes can present with a clinical phenotype very similar to that of HD","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"Huntington disease\\", \\"HD\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2017 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Unlike MultiBox, we then match default boxes to any ground truth with jaccard overlap higher than a threshold (0.5). This simplifies the learning problem, allowing the network to predict high scores for multiple overlapping default boxes rather than requiring it to pick only the one with maximum overlap.Question: How does the SSD match the default bounding box with ground truth ones?","answer":"To match the ground truth box with default box, authors used Best Jaccard Overlap.

As unification-based grammatical frameworks are extended to handle richer descriptions of linguistic information, they begin to share many of the properties that have been developed in KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems. This commonality suggests that some of the classification-based representation techniques can be applied to unification-based linguistic descriptions. This merging supports the integration of semantic and syntactic information into the same system, simultaneously subject to the same types of processes, in an efficient manner. The result is expected to be more efficient parsing due to the increased organization of knowledge. The use of a KL-ONE style representation for parsing and semantic interpretation was first explored in the PSI-KLONE system -LSB- 2 -RSB-, in which parsing is characterized as an inference process called incremental description refinement.","answer":"[[\\"parsing\\", \\"semantic interpretation\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"incremental description refinement\\", \\"parsing\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"unification-based grammatical frameworks\\", \\"linguistic information\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"classification-based knowledge representation\\", \\"unification-based parsing\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"PSI-KLONE system\\", \\"KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"approach\\", \\"parsing\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems\\", \\"parsing\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems\\", \\"unification-based grammatical frameworks\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems\\", \\"semantic interpretation\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"unification-based parsing\\", \\"approach\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"incremental description refinement\\", \\"inference process\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"classification-based knowledge representation\\", \\"approach\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"classification-based representation techniques\\", \\"unification-based linguistic descriptions\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"semantic and syntactic information\\", \\"approach\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial.                Long haul return flights from Auckland, New Zealand, to London and back.                Twenty volunteers with experience of transcontinental flights (eight women and 12 men aged 28 to 68).                Melatonin (or placebo) 5 mg three days before flight, during flight, and once a day for three days after arrival.                Symptoms of jet lag.                Visual analogue scale for feelings of jet lag and tiredness; profile of moods states questionnaire for vigour-activity and fatigue-inertia; and retrospective ratings 10 days after arrival of sleep pattern, energy, and daytime tiredness. Feelings of jet lag were less for subjects taking melatonin (mean score 2.15 v 3.4); these subjects took fewer days than the placebo group to establish a normal sleep pattern (2.85 v 4.15), to not feel tired during the day (3.0 v 4.6), and to reach normal energy levels (3.25 v 4.7). Results for fatigue-inertia and vigour-activity were similar. For all subjects jet lag was more severe on the return (westward) than the outward (eastward) journey.                Melatonin can alleviate jet lag and tiredness after long haul flights.Title 2:Melatonin and jet lag: confirmatory result using a simplified protocol.Abstract 2:This study replicates the alleviation of jet-lag with melatonin in a simplified protocol for eastward flight. At 22-n hr (n is the time-lag between the North American departure point and France), subjects took either melatonin (8 mg, n = 15), or placebo (n = 15) on the day of the return flight and for 3 consecutive days. On day 8, self-ratings significantly discriminated between melatonin and placebo for global treatment efficacy, morning fatigue, and evening sleepiness.Title 3:Comparative study to determine the optimal melatonin dosage form for the alleviation of jet lag.Abstract 3:To compare the impact of various dosage forms of melatonin and placebo on jet lag symptoms, 320 volunteers who had flights over 6 to 8 time zones were recruited for a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The volunteers received either melatonin 0.5-mg fast-release (FR) formulation, melatonin 5-mg FR formulation, melatonin 2-mg controlled-release (CR) formulation, or placebo. The study medication was taken once daily at bedtime during 4 days after an eastward flight. The volunteers completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS), sleep log, and symptoms questionnaires once daily and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) three times daily prior to departure and during the 4 days of medication intake postflight. A total of 234 (73.1%) participants were compliant and completed the study. The FR melatonin formulations were more effective than the slow-release formulation. The 5-mg FR formulation significantly improved the self-rated sleep quality (p < .05), shortened sleep latency (p < .05), and reduced fatigue and daytime sleepiness (p < .05) after intercontinental flight. The lower physiological dose of 0.5 mg was almost as effective as the pharmacological dose of 5.0 mg. Only the hypnotic properties of melatonin, sleep quality and sleep latency, were significantly greater with the 5.0-mg dose.Title 4:Jet lag: clinical features, validation of a new syndrome-specific scale, and lack of response to melatonin in a randomized, double-blind trial.Abstract 4:The goals of this study were to validate a new rating scale for measuring severity of jet lag and to compare the efficacy of contrasting melatonin regimens to alleviate jet lag.                This was a randomized, double-blind trial of placebo and three alternative regimens of melatonin (5.0 mg at bedtime, 0.5 mg at bedtime, and 0.5 mg taken on a shifting schedule) for jet lag. The subjects were 257 Norwegian physicians who had visited New York for 5 days. Jet lag ratings were made on the day of travel from New York back to Oslo (6 hours eastward) and for the next 6 days in Norway. The main outcome measures were scale and item scores from a new, syndrome-specific instrument, the Columbia Jet Lag Scale, that identifies prominent daytime symptoms of jet lag distress.                There was a marked increase in total jet lag score in all four treatment groups on the first day at home, followed by progressive improvement over the next 5 days. However, there were no significant group differences or group-by-time interactions. In addition, there was no group effect for sleep onset, time of awakening, hours slept, or hours napping. Ratings on a summary jet lag item were highly correlated with total jet lag scores (from a low of r = 0.54 on the day of travel to a high of r = 0.80 on day 3). The internal consistency of the total jet lag score was high on each day of the study.                The use of melatonin for preventing jet lag needs further study.Title 5:A double-blind trial of melatonin as a treatment for jet lag in international cabin crew.Abstract 5:This study investigated the efficacy of oral melatonin in alleviating jet lag in flight crew after a series of international flights. The optimal time for taking melatonin in this group was also investigated. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 52 international cabin crew were randomly assigned to three groups; early melatonin (5 mg started 3 days prior to arrival until 5 days after return home); late melatonin (placebo for 3 days then 5 mg melatonin for 5 days); and placebo. Daily ratings showed a trend in jet lag, mood, and sleepiness measures toward an improved recovery in the late melatonin group and a worse recovery in the early melatonin group as compared to placebo. Retrospective ratings made 6 days after arrival showed the late melatonin group reported significantly less jet lag and sleep disturbance following the flight compared to placebo. The late melatonin group also showed a significantly faster recovery of energy and alertness than the early melatonin group, which reported a worse overall recovery than placebo. These findings show melatonin may have potential benefits for international aircrew.Title 6:Use of melatonin in recovery from jet-lag following an eastward flight across 10 time-zones.Abstract 6:Subjective, physiological and physical performance variables are affected following travel across multiple time-zones (jet-lag). The objective of the study was to examine the effects of oral melatonin in alleviating jet-lag by investigating its effects on subjects who had flown from London to Eastern Australia, 10 time-zones to the east. Melatonin (5 mg day(-1)) or placebo capsules were administered to 14 experimental (13 males and 1 female) and 17 control subjects (15 males and 2 females), respectively, in a double-blind study; the time of administration was in accord with the current consensus for maximizing its hypnotic effect. Grip strength and intra-aural temperature were measured on alternate days after arrival at the destination, at four different times of day (between the times 07:00 - 08:00 h, 12:00 - 13:00 h, 16:00 - 17:00 h and 19:00 - 20:00 h local time). In addition, for the first 6 - 7 days after arrival in Australia, subjective ratings of jet-lag on a 0 - 10 visual analogue scale and responses to a Jet-lag Questionnaire (incorporating items for tiredness. sleep, meal satisfaction and ability to concentrate) were recorded at the above times and also on retiring (at about midnight). Subjects continued normally with their work schedules between the data collection times. Subjects with complete data (13 melatonin and 13 placebo subjects), in comparison with published data, showed partial adjustment of the diurnal rhythm in intra-aural temperature after 6 days. A time-of-day effect was evident in both right and left grip strength during adjustment to Australian time; there was no difference between the group taking melatonin and that using the placebo. Right and left grip strength profiles on day 6 were adjusted either by advancing or delaying the profiles, independent of whether subjects were taking melatonin or placebo tablets. Subjects reported disturbances with most measures in the Jet-lag Questionnaire but, whereas poorer concentration and some negative effects upon sleep had disappeared after 3 - 5 days, ratings of jet-lag and tiredness had not returned to 'zero' (or normal values), respectively, by the sixth day of the study. Subjects taking melatonin showed no significant differences from the placebo group in perceived irritability, concentration, meal satisfaction, ease in getting to sleep and staying asleep, frequency of bowel motion and consistency of the faeces. These results suggest that, in subjects who, after arrival, followed a busy schedule which resulted in frequent and erratic exposure to daylight, melatonin had no benefit in alleviating jet-lag or the components of jet-lag, and it did not influence the process of phase adjustment.","answer":"Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet lag, and occasional short-term use appears to be safe. It should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones, particularly in an easterly direction, and especially if they have experienced jet lag on previous journeys. Travellers crossing 2-4 time zones can also use it if need be. The pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study, and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be established. The effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy, and a possible interaction with warfarin, need investigation."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We r and omly selected 30 systematic review s from a data base . Each was assessed by two review ers using : ( 1 ) the enhanced quality assessment question naire ( Overview of Quality Assessment Question naire [ OQAQ ] ) ; ( 2 ) Sacks ' instrument ; and ( 3 ) our newly developed measurement tool ( AMSTAR ) . We report on reliability ( interobserver kappas of the 11 AMSTAR items ) , intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) of the sum scores , construct validity ( ICCs of the sum scores of AMSTAR compared with those of other instruments ) , and completion times . RESULTS The interrater agreement of the individual items of AMSTAR was substantial with a mean kappa of 0.70 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.57 , 0.83 ) ( range : 0.38 - 1.0 ) . Kappas recorded for the other instruments were 0.63 ( 95 % CI : 0.38 , 0.78 ) for enhanced OQAQ and 0.40 ( 95 % CI : 0.29 , 0.50 ) for the Sacks ' instrument . The ICC of the total score for AMSTAR was 0.84 ( 95 % CI : 0.65 , 0.92 ) compared with 0.91 ( 95 % CI : 0.82 , 0.96 ) for OQAQ and 0.86 ( 95 % CI : 0.71 , 0.94 ) for the Sacks ' instrument . AMSTAR proved easy to apply , each review taking about 15 minutes to complete . CONCLUSIONS AMSTAR has good agreement , reliability , construct validity , and feasibility . These findings need confirmation by a broader range of assessors and a more diverse range of reviewTitle 2:Low-sodium diet in pregnancy: effects on blood pressure and maternal nutritional status.Abstract 2:In ninety-four Dutch nulliparous women the effects of a  low-Na diet  in pregnancy on blood pressure , energy and nutrient intake , Ca metabolism , Zn and Mg status and body composition were studied longitudinally . The women were r and omly divided into an intervention group ( n 41 ) , which used a low-Na diet ( mean urinary Na excretion 61 mmol/24 h ) from week 14 of pregnancy until delivery and a control group ( n 53 ; mean urinary Na excretion 142 mmol/24 h ) . No effect of the diet on blood pressure was observed . The use of a low-Na diet result ed in significantly reduced intakes of energy , protein , carbohydrates , fat , Ca , Zn , Mg , Fe and cholesterol . However , the women on the low-Na diet appeared to be able to adapt quite well to the reduced intake since Ca , Zn and Mg homeostasis was maintained . In the case of Ca and Mg this was probably due to the observed reduced urinary excretions of these nutrients . Non-significant reductions in weight gain ( 1.5 kg ) and fat-mass gain ( 0.9 kg ) over pregnancy were found in the women on the low-Na diet . No significant effects of the diet on birth weight or placental weight were observedTitle 3:Weight Gain in Women of Normal Weight Before Pregnancy: Complications in Pregnancy or Delivery and Birth OutcomeAbstract 3:OBJECTIVE To investigate the relation between gestational weight gain in women of normal prepregnant weight and complications during pregnancy and delivery in a population with high gestational weight gain and birth weight . METHODS Healthy women ( n = 615 ) of normal weight before pregnancy ( body mass index 19.5–25.5 kg/m2 ) were r and omly selected . Maternity records gave information on age , height , prepregnant weight , gestational weight gain , parity , smoking , gestational hypertension and diabetes , preeclampsia , delivery complications , and infants ' birth size and health . RESULTS The mean weight gain in pregnancy was 16.8 ± 4.9 kg ( mean ± st and ard deviation ) . A total of 26.4 % of the women had complications , either in pregnancy ( 9.1 % ) or delivery ( 17.3 % ) . Women gaining weight according to the recommendation of the Institute of Medicine ( 11.5–16.0 kg ) had lower frequency of pregnancy‐delivery complications than women gaining more than 20.0 kg ( P = .017 ) , but did not differ significantly from those gaining 16–20 kg ( P > .05 ) . When dividing weight gain in pregnancy into quintiles , a relative risk of 2.69 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.01 , 7.18 , P = .048 ) was found for complications in pregnancy in the fourth quintile ( 17.9–20.8 kg ) , using the second quintile as reference ( 12.5–15.5 kg ) . The mean birth weight was 3778 ± 496 g. A low weight gain in pregnancy ( less than 11.5 kg ) was associated with an increased frequency of infants weighing less than 3500 g at birth ( P < .01 ) . CONCLUSION A gestational weight gain of 11.5–16.0 kg ( Institute of Medicine recommendation ) for women of normal prepregnant weight is related to the lowest risk for pregnancy‐delivery complications . In the population studied , the upper limit might be higher ( up to 18 kg ) , and low weight gain should be avoided to optimize birth outcomeTitle 4:Randomized controlled trial to prevent excessive weight gain in pregnant womenAbstract 4:BACKGROUND : The Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) recommends that normal‐weight women ( BMI ( body mass index ) of 19.8–26.0 ) gain 25–35 lb ( 11.4–15.9 kg ) during pregnancy , and that overweight women ( BMI of 26.1–29.0 ) gain 15–25 lbs ( 6.8–11.4 kg ) . A significant number of normal‐weight women and an even greater proportion of overweight women exceed these guidelines , which increases postpartum weight retention and may contribute to the development of obesity . OBJECTIVE : To determine whether a stepped care , behavioral intervention will decrease the percentage of women who gain more than the IOM recommendation . DESIGN : R and omized controlled trial comparing a stepped-care behavioral intervention with usual care .  Women ( n=120 ) who had a BMI > 19.8 , age>18 and < 20 weeks gestation were recruited from a hospital-based clinic serving low-income women and r and omized by race and BMI category to the intervention or control group . The intervention group received education about weight gain , healthy eating , and exercise and individual graphs of their weight gain . Those exceeding weight gain goals were given more intensive intervention . Women were followed through pregnancy to their first postpartum clinic visit . The main outcome measure was weight gain during pregnancy categorized as above the IOM recommendations vs below or within the IOM recommendations . RESULTS : The intervention significantly decreased the percentage of normal-weight women who exceeded the IOM recommendations ( 33 vs 58 % , P<0.05 ) . There was a non-significant ( P=0.09 ) effect in the opposite direction among overweight women ( 59 % of intervention and 32 % of control gained more than recommended ) . Postpartum weight retention was strongly related to weight gain during pregnancy ( r=0.89 ) . CONCLUSIONS : The intervention reduced excessive weight gain during pregnancy among normal weight womenTitle 5:A randomised controlled trial of dietary energy restriction in the management of obese women with gestational diabetesAbstract 5:Summary : A r and omised controlled trial was design ed to determine the effect of moderate 30 % maternal dietary energy restriction on the requirement for maternal insulin therapy  and the incidence of macrosomia in gestational diabetes .  Although the control group restricted their intake to a level similar to that of the intervention group ( 6845 kiloJoules ( kJ ) versus 6579 kJ ) , the result ing cohort could not identify any adverse effect of energy restriction in pregnancy . Energy restriction did not alter the frequency of insulin therapy ( 17.5 % in the intervention group and 16.9 % in the control group ) . Mean birth weight  ( 3461 g in the intervention group and 3267 g in the control group ) was not affected . There was a trend in the intervention group towards later gestational age at commencement of insulin therapy ( 33 weeks versus 31 weeks ) and lower maximum daily insulin dose ( 23 units versus 60 units ) which did not reach statistical significance . Energy restriction did not cause an increase in ketonemiaTitle 6:Intervening to reduce weight gain in pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus in Cree communities: an evaluation.Abstract 6:BACKGROUND A high prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes has been observed among the Cree of James Bay , Quebec . To address this problem , a diet and activity intervention during pregnancy , which was based on social learning theory , was initiated in 4 Cree communities . METHODS A prospect i ve intervention compared dietary , weight and glycemic indicators for 107 control subjects and for 112 women who received the intervention during the course of their pregnancy . A control period in 4 communities ( July 1995-March 1996 ) was followed by an intervention period ( April 1996-January 1997 ) when subjects were offered regular , individual diet counselling , physical activity sessions and other activities related to nutrition . RESULTS The intervention and control groups did not differ at baseline regarding their mean age ( 24.3 years [ SD 6.29 ] v. 23.8 years [ SD 5.86 ] ) , mean prepregnancy weight ( 81.0 kg [ SD 19.46 ] v. 78.9 kg [ SD 17.54 ] ) and mean gestational age at recruitment ( 17.1 weeks [ SD 7.06 ] v. 18.5 weeks [ SD 6.92 ] ) . The intervention did not result in differences in diet measured at 24 - 30 weeks ' gestation , rate of weight gain over the second half of pregnancy ( 0.53 kg per week [ SD 0.32 ] v. 0.53 kg per week [ SD 0.27 ] ) or plasma glucose level ( 50 g oral glucose screen ) between 24 and 30 weeks ( 7.21 mmol/L [ SD 2.09 ] v. 7.43 mmol/L [ SD 2.10 ] ) . Mean birth weights were similar ( 3741 g [ SD 523 ] v. 3686 g [ SD 686 ] ) , as was maternal weight at 6 weeks post partum ( 88.1 kg [ SD 16.8 ] v. 86.4 kg [ SD 19.0 ] ) . The only changes in dietary intake were a reduction in caffeine ( pregnancy ) and an increase in folate ( post partum ) . INTERPRETATION This intervention had only a minor impact on diet ; finding ways of encouraging appropriate body weight and activity levels remains a challengeTitle 7:Modifiable behavioral factors in a biopsychosocial model predict inadequate and excessive gestational weight gain.Abstract 7:OBJECTIVE The research addresses two questions : Are potentially modifiable psychosocial and behavioral factors related to gestational weight gain ? Do the same factors relate to both excessive and insufficient weight gain ? DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study that followed women from early pregnancy until two years postpartum . Data were collected through mailed question naires and an audit of the medical record . Subjects/ setting The sample included 622 healthy adult women who gave birth to live singleton infants . Subjects were recruited from all women who registered for prenatal care in a hospital and primary care clinic system serving a 10-county area of Upstate New York . Statistical analyses performed Multiple linear and logistic regression with adjustment for timing of measurements and length of gestation were performed . RESULTS Only 38 % of women gained an amount of weight in pregnancy that was within the range recommended by the Institute of Medicine . Valid and easily implemented measures of change in food intake and physical activity from prepregnancy and cigarette smoking during pregnancy were each significantly ( P<.05 ) and independently related to gestational weight gain . Along with other variables in a biopsychosocial regression model , these variables accounted for 27 % of the variance in gestational weight gain and were also significantly related to risk of inadequate and excessive gain . APPLICATIONS/ CONCLUSIONS The findings facilitate the design of more effective nutrition interventions to promote appropriate gestational weight gain and the long-term health of women and their infantsTitle 8:Gestational Weight Gain, Pregnancy Outcome, and Postpartum Weight RetentionAbstract 8:Objective To determine whether the risk of maternal overweight associated with an excessive rate of gestational gain needs to be balanced against the risks of impaired fetal growth associated with a low rate of gain . Methods  Rate of gestational weight gain  was measured prospect ively in a sample of 274 young , low-income , and primarily minority women ( 12–29 years old ) with pregravid body mass indices ( BMI ) in the normal range ( 19.8–26.0 ) . We defined an excessive rate of gain between 20–36 weeks ' gestation as one greater than 0.68 kg/week , and a low rate of gain as one less than 0.34 kg/week . Women were followed-up at 4–6 weeks and 6 months postpartum . Results Rate of measured gestational gain between 20–36 weeks ' gestation was associated with total weight gain based on pregravid weight , with infant birth weight and gestation duration , and with maternal overweight ( BMI greater than 26 ) and weight retention postpartum . Infant birth weight and gestation duration were significantly reduced for women with low rates of gain , and there was no significant difference between women with excessive and moderate gains . Despite little difference in pregravid BMI , women with excessive rates of gain retained more weight overall , attained a greater postpartum BMI , and had higher levels of subcutaneous fat and overweight . Maternal anthropometric status showed little change between 4–6 weeks and 6 months postpartum . Conclusion Weight gained at an excessive rate by women with a pregravid BMI in the normal range does not greatly enhance fetal growth and gestation duration , contributing instead to postpartum maternal overweight","answer":"The results of published intervention trials are of insufficient quality to enable evidence -based recommendations to be developed for clinical practice in antenatal care"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We report on the implementation of an Associative Capacitive Network (ACN) based on the nondestructive capacitive readout of two Complementary Resistive Switches (2-CRSs). ACNs are capable of performing a fully parallel search for Hamming distances (i.e. similarity) between input and stored templates. Unlike conventional associative memories where charge retention is a key function and hence, they require frequent refresh cycles, in ACNs, information is retained in a nonvolatile resistive state and normal tasks are carried out through capacitive coupling between input and output nodes. Each device consists of two CRS cells and no selective element is needed, therefore, CMOS circuitry is only required in the periphery, for addressing and read-out. Highly parallel processing, nonvolatility, wide interconnectivity and low-energy consumption are significant advantages of ACNs over conventional and emerging associative memories. These characteristics make ACNs one of the promising candidates for applications in memory-intensive and cognitive computing, switches and routers as binary and ternary Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) and intelligent data processing.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Each year at least 30 000 Western travellers acquire malaria and approximately 1-4% of those who acquire Plasmodium falciparum malaria will die as a result of infection. Almost all cases and fatalities are preventable with the use of measures to reduce mosquito bites and appropriate chemoprophylaxis for those at high risk of infection. There are currently a limited number of licensed drugs available to prevent malaria in travellers. New effective and well tolerated agents are urgently needed because of increasing resistance to antimalarials such as chloroquine and proguanil , and real and perceived intolerance to standard drugs such as mefloquine . A newly licensed antimalarial (atovaquone plus proguanil; Malarone) compares favourably with other drug options, although some prescribers may be unfamiliar with the specific advantages and disadvantages of this antimalarial. This article reviews recent clinical experience and randomised controlled trial data in order to address frequently asked questions about this new combination drug.sentence: New effective and well tolerated agents are urgently needed because of increasing resistance to antimalarials such as chloroquine and proguanil , and real and perceived intolerance to standard drugs such as mefloquine .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

In this research, the mathematical models, indicating the capability of various units, such as rapid mixing, coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, and the rapid sand filtration are used. Moreover, cost functions were used for the formulation of conventional water and wastewater treatment plant by applying Clark's formula (Clark, 1982). Also, by applying dynamic programming algorithm, it is easy to design a conventional treatment system with minimal cost. The application of the model for a case reduced the annual cost. This reduction was approximately in the range of 4.5-9.5% considering variable limitations. Sensitivity analysis and prediction of system's feedbacks were performed for different alterations in proportion from parameters optimized amounts. The results indicated (1) that the objective function is more sensitive to design flow rate (Q), (2) the variations in the alum dosage (A), and (3) the sand filter head loss (H). Increasing the inflow by 20%, the total annual cost would increase to about 12.6%, while 20% reduction in inflow leads to 15.2% decrease in the total annual cost.

Limited availability of high-resolution computed tomography and real-time polymerase chain reaction in developing countries and regions of high patient turnover also emphasizes the importance of chest radiography as both a screening and diagnostic tool. In this paper, we compare the performance of 17 available deep learning algorithms to help identify imaging features of COVID19 pneumonia. We utilize an existing diagnostic technology (chest radiography) and preexisting neural networks (DarkNet-19) to detect imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our approach eliminates the extra time and resources needed to develop new technology and associated algorithms, thus aiding the front-line healthcare workers in the race against the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that DarkNet-19 is the optimal pre-trained neural network for the detection of radiographic features of COVID-19 pneumonia, scoring an overall accuracy of 94.28% over 5,854 X-ray images. We also present a custom visualization of the results that can be used to highlight important visual biomarkers of the disease and disease progression.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

There is still, however, limited knowledge on the expression and function of several of the mammalian NLR proteins in myeloid lineages. Still, the function of pyrin domain -containing NLR proteins and NLRC4 / NAIP as inflammasome components that drive interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 maturation and secretion upon pathogen stimulation is well established. NOD1, NOD2, NLRP3, and NLRC4 / NAIP act as bona fide pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) but also react to endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Ultimately, activation of these receptors achieves macrophage activation and maturation of dendritic cells to drive antigen-specific adaptive immune responses. Upon infection, sensing of invading pathogens and likely of DAMPs that are released in response to tissue injury is a process that involves multiple PRRs in both myeloid and epithelial cells, and these act in concert to design tailored, pathogen - adapted immune responses by induction of different cytokine profiles, giving rise to appropriate lymphocyte polarization.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"myeloid lineages\\", \\"myeloid\\", \\"myeloid cells\\", \\"dendritic cells\\", \\"Myeloid Cells\\", \\"epithelial cells\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Functions\\", \\"adaptive immune responses\\", \\"infection\\", \\"Adaptive Immunity\\", \\"immune functions\\", \\"lymphocyte polarization\\", \\"secretion\\", \\"expression\\", \\"adapted immune responses\\", \\"maturation\\", \\"macrophage activation\\", \\"activation of these receptors\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"NLRC4\\", \\"IL-18\\", \\"DAMPs\\", \\"NLR proteins\\", \\"pattern recognition receptors\\", \\"NOD1\\", \\"Toll-like receptor proteins\\", \\"IL-1u03b2\\", \\"antigen-specific\\", \\"inflammasome\\", \\"NOD2\\", \\"PRRs\\", \\"danger-associated molecular patterns\\", \\"NOD-like receptor (NLR) proteins\\", \\"NAIP\\", \\"interleukin-1u03b2\\", \\"NOD-Like Receptor Proteins\\", \\"NLRP3\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"mammalian\\"], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"tissue injury\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"MAMPs\\", \\"pyrin domain\\", \\"microbe-associated molecular patterns\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We have cloned the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, mCB2, from a mouse splenocyte cDNA library. The 3.7 kb sequence contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 347 residues sharing 82% overall identity with the only other known peripheral receptor, human CB2 (hCB2) and shorter than hCB2 by 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Binding experiments with membranes from COS-3 cells transiently expressing mCB2 showed that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55212-2 had a 6-fold lower affinity for mCB2 than for hCB2, whereas both receptors showed similar affinities for the agonists CP 55,940, delta(9)-THC and anandamide and almost no affinity for the central receptor- (CB1) specific antagonist SR 141716A. Both hCB2 and mCB2 mediate agonist-stimulated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO cell lines permanently expressing the receptors. SR 141716A failed to antagonize this activity in either cell line, confirming its specificity for CB1.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"hCB2\\", \\"peripheral receptor\\", \\"mCB2\\", \\"central receptor\\", \\"CB1\\", \\"peripheral cannabinoid receptor\\", \\"CB2\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

To date, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are becoming the new therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In this study, a cell-based high-throughput PPARs (PPARα/β/γ) model was developed for the screening of PPARs agonists. The screening conditions were evaluated through analyzing the expression value of luciferase. Finally, 24   h of drug acting time, 5 times of the dilution factor of luciferase zymolyte, and about 2   ×   10 (4) cells/ well on HeLa cells in 96-well plates were used, respectively. Furthermore, the quality of high-throughput screening (HTS) in stability and reliability was evaluated by the Z'-factor. Additionally, different extracts of Rhizoma Coptis and berberine were tested by the developed method. The results suggested that both the EtOAc extract and berberine were able to activate PPARα/β/γ, and Rhizoma Coptis contains potential natural agonists of PPARs besides berberine. In conclusion, the developed HTS assay is a simple, rapid, stable, and specific method for the screening of PPARs natural agonists.","answer":"[[\\"berberine\\", \\"AGONIST-ACTIVATOR\\", \\"PPARu03b1/u03b2/u03b3\\"], [\\"berberine\\", \\"AGONIST\\", \\"PPARs\\"], [\\"EtOAc\\", \\"AGONIST-ACTIVATOR\\", \\"PPARu03b1/u03b2/u03b3\\"]]"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

In this paper, as an exercise in synthesis and for the sake of stimulating thoughts and discussion, we review the format of previous ICKEPS, to suggest alternative formats for future competitions, ideally to motivate someone to step up and organise the next ones.The International Competition on Knowledge Engineering for Planning and Scheduling (ICKEPS) has been running since 2005 as an almost biennial event promoting the development and importance of the use of knowledge engineering (KE) methods and techniques within this area.The aim of the competition series is to foster developments in the knowledge-based and domain modelling aspects of Automated Planning, to accelerate knowledge engineering research, to encourage the creation and sharing of prototype tools and software platforms that promise more rapid, accessible, and effective ways to construct reliable and efficient Automated Planning systems.The latest competition took place in 2016 1 BID3 , which aimed at on-site domain modelling, and highlighted a number of major issues.Most teams did not use any of the existing KE tools, and thus relied only on their expertise.Second, existing tools do not effectively support cooperation, which is needed to cope with the growing complexity of planning applications.Finally, and more worryingly, the number of participants of ICKEPS is still not very large, especially when compared with the latest edition of the International Planning Competition: this suggests that the planning community underestimates the importance of knowledge engineering, despite of its enormous impact on applicability of domain-independent planning in real-world scenarios.Accidental complexity issues BID2 , for instance, can prevent the exploitation of automated planning approaches in complex scenarios, and even an unfortunate ordering of elements in the domain model can adversely affect the performance of planning engines BID7 .Giventhe pivotal role played by ICKEPS in promoting the importance of principled KE approaches and tools, we believe it is important to evolve and adapt its format in order to attract and engage a larger number of participants. In thispaper, we review the format of past competitions, in order to highlight weaknesses and strengths both from organisers' and participants' perspective. Buildingon top of this analysis, we suggest some alternative formats that may help future ICKEPS organisers in performing their tasks.It should be noted, though, that the aim of this paper is twofold: to review formats and suggest improvements to ICKEPS, and -more importantly-to make a call for action for organising future competitions focused on KE aspects of planning and scheduling.Concluding this paper, we believe that there is a strong need to organise the ICKEPS competitions in order to increase awareness of KE techniques, tool and issues in the ICAPS and general AI communities.The success of future ICK-EPS competitions (e.g. considerable increase of the number of participants) can, in consequence, influence the domainindependent AI planning field by making it accessible for use (by planning non-experts) in various application domains.To give some motivation and inspiration for the future ICKEPS competitions, we, in this paper, provided a review of the format of the past ICKEPS competitions, and suggested two possibly new formats that, we believe, can at-tract more participants and possibly avoid an excessive burden of organisers.We believe that the paper initiates a fruitful discussion about the format of future ICKEPS competitions as well as motivate potential organisers to step up and organise the next competition(s).","answer":"Ideas for future ICKEPS"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Sixty patients were randomised into two treatment groups. One group used an antibacterial/anti-inflammatory ear drop preparation (Otosporin) and the other group a similar preparation administered as an ear spray (Otomize). A 'blind' clinical assessment was made one and three weeks after commencing treatment. Both treatments (drops and spray) significantly improved patients' symptoms and signs after one week (p < 0.001). The spray was significantly easier to administer (p < 0.01) and caused less discomfort on application (p < 0.02).Title 2:Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ciprofloxacin alone in pediatric patients with acute otitis media and otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.Abstract 2:To determine whether topical administration of a corticosteroid improves resolution of acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea when combined with topical antibiotic drops.                Randomized, patient-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial of topical otic ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone versus topical ciprofloxacin alone in 201 children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) of less than or equal to 3 weeks' duration and visible otorrhea.                Eligible patients were randomized to receive three drops of either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% or ciprofloxacin 0.3% into the affected ear or ears twice daily for 7 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3, 8 (end-of-therapy), and 14 (test-of-cure), and twice-daily assessments of otorrhea were recorded in patient diaries.                The mean time to cessation of otorrhea in the microbiologically culture-positive patient population (n = 167) was significantly shorter with topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone than with ciprofloxacin alone (4.22 vs. 5.31 days; P =.004). This resulted in significantly better clinical responses on days 3 and 8 (P <.0001 and P =.0499, respectively). However, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in either the clinical response or the microbial eradication rate by day 14.                Topical otic treatment with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to treatment with ciprofloxacin alone and results in a faster clinical resolution in children with AOMT. The contribution of the corticosteroid in achieving a 20% reduction (1.1 day) in time to cessation of otorrhea is clinically meaningful and represents an important advance over single-agent antibiotic therapy.Title 3:Antibiotic treatment of acute otorrhea through tympanostomy tube: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with daily follow-up.Abstract 3:The role of routine antimicrobial treatment of acute middle-ear infections is under debate, because the efficacy of antimicrobials in the resolution of middle-ear fluid has not been unambiguously proven. Acute tube otorrhea is regarded as evidence of acute otitis media, and for methodologic reasons it was chosen to provide objectivity for diagnostics and outcome assessment. The objective of this study was to assess whether amoxicillin-clavulanate accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea.                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in outpatient setting.                Volunteer sample of basically healthy 6- to 72-month-old children with a tympanostomy tube. Eligibility required having acute tube otorrhea of <48 hours' of duration and no prior treatment within the last 2 weeks. The mean age of the participants was 25 months; they had a history of 3 episodes of acute otitis media (median), and 99% had manifestations of a concomitant respiratory infection. Of 79 randomized patients, 7 were withdrawn because of adverse events; 66 patients completed the study.                Amoxicillin-clavulanate (N = 34; 45 mg/kg/d) or matching placebo (N = 32) for 7 days and daily suction of middle-ear fluid through tympanostomy tube.                Duration of acute tube otorrhea and duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.                The median duration of tube otorrhea was significantly shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (3 vs 8 days). At the end of the 7-day medication period, tube otorrhea was resolved in 28 of 34 children receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 13 of 32 children on placebo (treatment-control difference 41%; 95% confidence interval, 20%-63%; number needed to treat, 2.4). The median duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid was shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (1 vs 8 days).                Oral antibiotic treatment significantly accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea by reducing bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.Title 4:Oral prednisolone is an effective adjuvant therapy for acute otitis media with discharge through tympanostomy tubes.Abstract 4:To determine the efficacy of a short course of oral prednisolone as an adjuvant therapy for acute otitis media draining through tympanostomy tubes.                In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, children with acute discharge (<48 hours) through tympanostomy tubes received either prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d; n = 23) or placebo (n = 27) for 3 days. All children received amoxicillin/clavulanate (40/10 mg/kg/d) for 7 days. The children were examined daily at the study clinic until the drainage ceased.                The median duration of otorrhea in the prednisolone group was 1.0 days (25% to 75% range, 1.0 to 2.0 days), compared with 3.0 days (25% to 75% range, 2.0 to 4.0 days) in the children receiving placebo (P <.001). The duration of otorrhea was </=2 days in 21 (91%) children in the prednisolone group, compared with 8 (30%) children in the placebo group (P <.001).                Oral prednisolone appears to be modestly effective adjuvant therapy for acute otitis media with discharge through tympanostomy tubes in children. Further studies seem warranted to determine whether short-term use of steroids early during the course of acute otitis media would also reduce the duration of middle ear effusion in children with intact tympanic membranes.","answer":"The authors of this review have been unable to identify the most effective intervention or to assess the associated risks.

Tropical countries will face complex epidemiological scenarios involving the simultaneous transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti. The occurrence of arboviral diseases with COVID-19 in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region presents challenges and opportunities for strengthening health services, surveillance and control programs. Financing of training, equipment and reconversion of hospital spaces will have a negative effect on already the limited resource directed to the health sector. The strengthening of the diagnostic infrastructure reappears as an opportunity for the national reference laboratories. Sharing of epidemiological information for the modeling of epidemiological scenarios allows collaboration between health, academic and scientific institutions. The fear of contagion by COVID-19 is constraining people with arboviral diseases to search for care which can lead to an increase in serious cases and could disrupt the operation of vector-control programs due to the reluctance of residents to open their doors to health personnel. Promoting intense community participation along with the incorporation of long lasting innovations in vector control offers new opportunities for control. The COVID-19 pandemic offers challenges and opportunities that must provoke positive behavioral changes and encourage more permanent self-care actions.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

axis , only half of the solution is displayed .the arrows display the velocity field whereas the thick solid line is the magnetic field line at the current time step .the thin solid line is the initial magnetic field line .three timesteps are displayed .first panel shows that the converging flow has bended the field lines therefore increasing the magnetic pressure .this has the effect to slow down the gas and tends to stop the condensation .however in the same way , magnetic tension has generated a transverse flow .second panel reveals that the transverse flow has significantly unbended the magnetic field lines and therefore decreases the magnetic pressure . as a consequencethe condensation can proceed along the field line as shown in third panel .figure 2 shows the condensation threshold for various values of the angle @xmath1 and the magnetic intensity for 2 different values of the initial velocity field .when the magnetic intensity is small , @xmath1 decreases rapidly when @xmath2 increases .this is a natural consequence of the magnetic pressure being stronger .however for intermediate values of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 g ) , @xmath1 does not decreases anymore when @xmath2 increases and for strong values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 .this behaviour is a direct consequence of the magnetic tension which tends to unbend the field lines . indeed when the field is strong so that the magnetic energy dominates the kinematic one , the gas is constraint to flow along the field lines .an important consequence of this mechanism is that no correlation between the magnetic intensity and the density is expected in hi .this result first obtained in 1d by hennebelle & prault ( 2000 ) ( see also passot & vzquez - semadeni 2003 ) has been confirmed in 3d simulations by de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) .since magnetic and kinematical energies are roughly comparable in the hi , one expects magnetic field fluctuations to be important .we have therefore explored analytically and numerically the influence of alfvn waves on thermal instability ( hennebelle & passot 2006 ) . in particular an exact stability analysis of a non - linearcircularly polarized alfvn wave , of wavelength @xmath4 , propagating in a thermally unstable medium has been worked out .the conclusions of this analysis are i ) wavelengths larger than @xmath4 are generally stabilized against thermal instability by the alfvn wave , ii ) wavelengths slightly smaller than @xmath4 are generally destabilized and even more prone to thermal instability .this is a consequence of the parametric instability studied by goldstein ( 1978 ) .iii ) the wavelengths much smaller than @xmath4 are not affected by the alfvn wave . in order to confirm these results and to explore the non linear regime ,we have performed 1d numerical simulations .we setup a density perturbation into a thermally unstable gas that we let evolve .left panel of figure 3 shows that the perturbation has condensed and formed a cnm structure .when an alfvn wave is added , right panel of figure 3 shows that the evolution is drastically different . instead of one ,about 10 small structures of cnm have formed .this is because as shown by the analytical calculations , the waves have triggered the growth of smaller wavelengths .this mechanism together with turbulence ( audit & hennebelle 2005 ) is likely to play an important rle in the formation of the small scale cnm structures recently observed by braun & kanekar ( 2005 ) and stanimirovi & heiles ( 2005 )","answer":"the neutral atomic interstellar medium ( hi ) is well known to be strongly magnetized .  since hi is a 2-phase medium the questions arise of what is the effect of the magnetic field on a 2-phase medium , how magnetic field affects thermal instability ? here  we summarize analytical and numerical results which have been obtained previously to investigate this question ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Long term potentiation in the hippocampus, a potential neural substrate for learning and memory, is thought to be linked to calcium-triggered intracellular events. In this study, laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to examine the effects of Pb(2+) on intracellular and endoplasmic reticulum free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](ER)) in cultured neonatal rat hippocampal neurons and their possible antagonism by methionine choline; understanding these effects would help explain the lead-induced cognitive and learning dysfunction and explore efficient safety and relief strategies. The results showed that Pb(2+) increased [Ca(2+)](i) and decreased [Ca(2+)](ER) linearly in a time- and concentration-dependant manner, and Pb(2+) addition after the applying of a ryanodine receptor (RyR) antagonist and an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) antagonist did not increase [Ca(2+)](i). The addition of 10, 20, or 40 mmol/L methionine choline simultaneously with addition of 10 μmol/L Pb(2+) decreased [Ca(2+)](i) in Ca(2+)-free culture medium by 39.0%, 66.0%, and 61.6%, respectively, in a concentration-dependant manner in a certain dose range. Our results suggest that Pb(2+) induces ER calcium release to increase the resting [Ca(2+)](i); and methionine choline inhibit this increase in [Ca(2+)](i).","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate\\", \\"Ca(2+)\\", \\"calcium\\", \\"methionine choline\\", \\"ryanodine\\", \\"Pb(2+)\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"ryanodine receptor\\", \\"RyR\\", \\"inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor\\", \\"IP(3)R\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

For example, particles with silica (SiO2) or polystyrene (PS) cores and Ag or Au shells have been synthesized with controllable shell thicknesses between 5-20 nm.2,3,5,6</p><p>The synthesis of new types of core-shell particles requires either a modification of the core to promote metal seeding or the development of metal reduction strategies that can fully encapsulate the core. Fabrication strategies provide an approach to circumvent these chemical modification schemes, although most reports have only produced beads whose top surfaces were coated with metal. For example, e-beam deposition of Au onto SiO2 beads followed by chemical etching of the SiO2 resulted in Au \\"half-shell\\" particles that could be assembled into arrays and functionalized to be superhydrophobic.11 Similarly, modulated optical nanoprobes, which can be used as solution-based fluorescence tags, were fabricated by deposition of Au onto fluorescent PS particles.12</p><p>Here we describe a method to fabricate pyramidal core-shell particles by first assembling beads into pyramidal shells and then encapsulating the beads by e-beam deposition to form the top-shells. Our strategy enables the creation of core-shell nanoparticles with complex shapes, controllable dimensions, and flexible compositions with optical properties tunable at NIR wavelengths. Figure 1A outlines the fabrication scheme used to generate our core-shell particles. PEEL—Phase-shifting photolithography (PSP), Etching, E-beam, and Lift-off—was used to fabricate the bottom pyramidal shell.13 In previous work, Cr was used as the material for the etch and deposition mask;13 in this work, Ti was used because lift-off was easier. In brief, a Ti film perforated with 350-nm holes served as an etch mask through which the underlying Si (100) was anisotropically etched as well as a deposition mask through which Au (thickness, t = 25 nm) was deposited to form pyramidal shells. For all the core-shell pyramidal particles, t was kept constant.</p><p>We assembled the cores of our particles, either PS beads (d = 202 nm, n = 1.59; Polysciences) or SiO2 beads (d = 225 nm, n = 1.46), into the bottom-shells by first drop casting a solution of beads onto the template and then dragging a slab of PDMS across the surface so that the beads would settle into the pyramidal pits in a manner similar to gravure and high-resolution particle printing.14 We also assembled multiple, smaller diameter beads into individual shells, but to fabricate core-shell particles with a single bead with over 90% surface coverage, we chose beads with diameters of ca. 200 nm to maintain a size ratio of 1.715 with the hole in the Ti film. Core-shell pyramidal particles were also fabricated with melted PS cores (PSmelt) by heating the assembled beads in the substrate to 388 K in a muffle furnace for 15 min. Heating the PS above its glass transition temperature, Tg (373 K), allowed the PS to flow and fill the cavity of the pyramidal shell.</p><p>Pyramidal core-shell particles were completed by e-beam deposition of Au to form the top-shells (thickness t′ = 25 nm). For unmelted PS bead structures, we situated the sample on a tilted stage (θ = 15°) that rotated at 800 rpm. The tilted stage allowed the interface between the bead and the inner surface of the bottom pyramidal shell to be coated with metal. PS beads would often swell because of elevated temperatures during the deposition, however, which resulted in a small gap between the top-shell and the inner surface of the bottom-shell (Fig. 1B, C). For melted PS cores, the encapsulation was carried out by line-of-site deposition; because the top surface of the PS core was flat, there was no shadowing at the interface between the bottom-shell and the core (Fig. 1D, E). The Au/Ti film was then removed by soaking the substrates for 5-10 s in Ti etchant (Transcene, Titanium Etchant TFT), which dissolved the Ti mask and released the Au film to leave encapsulated, pyramidal core-shell particles. The particles were removed from the Si template by etching in gaseous XeF2 (XACTIX, Inc. Xetch e1 Series) and then sonicating in water.</p><p>Single particle, dark-field (DF) spectroscopy was used to characterize the optical properties of the pyramidal core-shell particles. Scattered light from the particles was collected with a variable numerical aperture objective (100X, NA = 0.5) under DF illumination using an inverted optical microscope (Nikon TE2000-U). Spectra were analyzed using a spectrometer (Jovin-Yvon TRIAX 550) equipped with a LN2 cooled imaging CCD detector (Jovin-Yvon Symphony). The dielectric environment surrounding the particles was changed using immersion oils with different refractive indices (n = 1.29, 1.40, 1.51, 1.60). To correlate scattering spectra with SEM images, core-shell particles were dispersed onto ITO-coated glass substrates (nITO = 1.8) patterned with markers. As discussed in previous work, Au pyramidal shells (the bottom-shell of our core-shell particles) exhibit orientation-dependant properties.16-18 When the tips point away from the surface (tip-up), the structures have higher intensity spectral features at lower wavelengths (550 -750 nm). In contrast, when the tips touch the surface (tip-down), the structures have spectral features of comparable intensity at both low and high wavelengths (550-950 nm). Because pyramidal core-shell particles favor a tip-down configuration, all particles were characterized in the tip-down orientation.</p><p>Figure 2 highlights the differences between two types of polystyrene core-shell particles: Au-PS-Au and Au-PSmelt-Au. Au-PS-Au particles exhibited scattering peaks at 640 nm and 900 nm, with the former being less intense than the latter. In contrast, the spectra of the Au-PSmelt-Au particles had sharper features and were composed of a shoulder at 600 nm, peaks at 665 nm and 770 nm, and a higher intensity peak at 875 nm. The blue resonances of both particles were slightly less intense than the red ones, and the long and short wavelength resonances had similar peak positions. Because the dielectric materials were identical, differences in the number of spectral features as well as their sharpness can be attributed to either the change in shape of the dielectric and/or the gap between the bottom-shell and top-shell of the Au-PS-Au particle. To investigate the origin of the differences between the spectra, we analyzed the individual structural components of the pyramidal core-shell particles. This ability to fabricate and characterize separated components is a unique advantage of our fabrication procedure (Fig. S1). Figure 3 displays the cartoons and spectra of the four components: (i) Au bottom-shell; (ii) spherical PS bead with Au top-shell; (iii) Au bottom-shell with melted PS; and (iv) flat Au top-shell. Structurally, Au-PS-Au particles can be considered as a combination of components (i) and (ii), which is also supported by SEM images that showed that the top-shell and bottom pyramidal shells were not physically connected. Note that (i) has upper edges that are thicker than t = 25 nm because of the angled deposition through the Ti mask (but without the bead) necessary to mimic the Au-PS-Au particles. Analysis of the individual parts—(i) with high intensity resonances in the red and (ii) with a single resonance at 625 nm—suggests that the spectra of these components can be combined to generate the plasmon features of the Au-PS-Au particles at nearly the same wavelengths (Fig. 3A). Although the resonance at 750 nm is present in component (i), this feature is not observed in the Au-PS-Au spectra possibly because of either damping effects from interactions between the shell and the bead or small morphological differences in the capping layer from the angled deposition.</p><p>Similarly, Au-PSmelt-Au core-shell particles can be constructed from components (iii) and (iv); however, in the case of these structures, the two components are connected. Investigation of these components—(iii) with two high intensity resonances in the far-red and (iv) with resonances at 660 nm and 890 nm—supports the hypothesis that the surface plasmon features of the components can be combined to generate the optical characteristics of the pyramidal core-shell structures (Fig. 3B). The resonances of the Au-PSmelt-Au particles were blue-shifted relative to its component resonances (Fig. S2). We attribute this blue-shift to increased interactions between the top- and bottom-shells because no shifting was observed for the Au-PS-Au particles (which have separated top- and bottom-shells).</p><p>To investigate how the spectral features of the core-shell pyramidal particles evolved under different dielectric environments, we changed the bulk n (Fig. 4). The plasmon resonances of both Au-PS-Au and Au-PSmelt-Au particles red-shifted with increasing n with a few notable exceptions: (1) the Au-PS-Au particle resonances blue-shifted under n = 1.60, which may be from index matching between the oil and the PS; (2) the Au-PSmelt-Au resonance at 890 nm shifted blue with increasing n; and (3) the Au-PSmelt-Au spectrum in n = 1.29 only had one prominent peak between 600-750 nm, which may be a result of the two short wavelength peaks overlapping or as a result of different resonance behavior in lower index media. Notably, the spectral features of the Au-PSmelt-Au particles were more sensitive to changes in n.</p><p>We investigated further the additive nature of the structural and optical properties of the components to produce pyramidal core-shells by analyzing the individual components (i)-(iv) under different n. Investigation of the optical spectra of the components provides some initial qualitative insight into the origins of the spectral features observed in the core-shell particle. For the case of Au-PS-Au particles (composed of (i) and (ii)), the spectra of (i) displayed similar resonance behavior under n = 1.60 and n = 1.51; however, in n = 1.29, the spectra changed into a broad, strong peak at long wavelengths (Fig. S3).The plasmon resonance of (ii) did not shift significantly under different n (Fig. S4), and the position was similar to the feature at 640 nm in the Au-PS-Au core-shell spectra. Because the spectral properties of these particles appear to be additive (we do not claim that they are an exact sum because of different local environments), large shifts in peak positions were not observed for Au-PS-Au particles in different dielectric environments because: (1) the red resonance position is most affected by the refractive index inside (i), and (2) the blue resonance is mostly from (ii), which showed only small red-shifts under increased n. For the Au-PSmelt-Au particles (composed of (iii) and (iv)), the spectra of (iii) showed little change in resonance position with n (Fig. S5). Significant peak shifts were observed for (iv) under different n, however, and especially under n = 1.29, where an additional resonance appeared in the farred, and the resonance at 890 nm blue-shifted (Fig. S6). Thus, the longer wavelength spectral features of the Au-PSmelt-Au core-shell particles seem to be dominated by contributions from (iv).</p><p>To demonstrate the flexibility of our fabrication method, we changed the core material to SiO2 and increased the top-shell thickness. SiO2 beads were synthesized by the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate via the Stöber method.19 The Au-SiO2-Au particles (t = 25 nm, t′ = 25 nm or 65 nm) were fabricated using the same assembly and tilted encapsulation method as Au-PS-Au; in the SiO2 core case, there was no swelling of the bead, and hence the particles were fully encapsulated. These particles also had similar spectral features to the Au-PS-Au particles with strong resonances at ∼600 nm and 915 nm on a broad background (Fig. 5). While both Au-SiO2-Au particles had a resonance at 915 nm, the blue resonance for the thicker top-shell particles shifted to lower wavelengths and became more intense than the red resonance. These changing peak intensities and blue-shifted resonances were similar to observations where the spherical core-shell particles had more shell material on one side than the other.20 Au-SiO2-Au particles (t′ = 25 nm) were also analyzed under different refractive index environments, where the red resonance shifted to longer wavelengths with increased n (Fig. S7). The intensity and peak position of the resonances are also similar to the Au-PS-Au particle, which suggests that the broadness of the peaks may be attributed to, in part, the air gap at the tip.</p><p>In summary, we have reported a highly controllable method for producing pyramidal core-shell particles with different dielectric cores. The properties can be altered by: (1) changing the shape of the dielectric core or (2) increasing the top-shell thickness. Our assembly strategy allows us to investigate how the individual components of the core-shell particles contribute to the optical properties, which enables a detailed understanding of the spectral properties of the particles. With the ability to fabricate anisotropic core-shell particles with virtually any material encapsulated, we anticipate this work will find applications as particles for photothermal therapy because of their near-IR optical properties, as vectors for the delivery of therapeutics, or as optical scattering tags for biological targets.</p>","answer":"This paper describes an approach to fabricate anisotropic core-shell particles by assembling dielectric beads within fabricated noble metal pyramidal structures. Particles with gold (Au) shells and different dielectric cores were generated, and their optical properties were characterized by single particle spectroscopy.

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between frequent recreational cannabis (FRC) (marijuana and hashish) use and periodontitis prevalence among adults in the United States. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011 to 2012 were analyzed. Primary outcome (periodontitis) was defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention / American Academy of Periodontology classification as well as continuous measurements of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (AL). Exposure of interest was self-reported cannabis use, defined as \\" FRC use \\" versus \\" non-FRC use .\\" Bivariate and multivariable regression models were performed using the entire analytical sample (model 1) as well as those who had never used tobacco (never-users) (model 2). Of 1,938 participants with available cannabis use data and essential covariates, 26.8% were FRC users. Mean number of sites per participant with PD ≥4, ≥6, and ≥8 mm and AL ≥3, ≥5, and ≥8 mm was significantly higher among FRC users than among non-FRC users (mean difference in number of PD sites: 6.9, 5.6, and 5.6; P <0.05; mean difference in number of AL sites: 12.7, 7.6, and 5.6; P <0.05). Average AL was higher among FRC users than among non-FRC users (1.8 versus 1.6 mm; P = 0.004). Bivariate analysis revealed positive (harmful) association between FRC use and severe periodontitis in the entire sample (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 2.4; P = 0.002) as well as in never-smokers (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2 to 3.5; P = 0.01). This association was retained in multivariable models adjusted for demographics (age, sex, race / ethnicity, and income level), alcohol and tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and past periodontal treatment (model 1: adjusted OR [aOR]: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.9; P = 0.07; model 2: aOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1 to 3.2; P = 0.03).

Randomised placebo controlled trials have shown that the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor cilostazol 100mg bid improves pain-free and maximum walking distance, as well as quality of life, in a range of patients with intermittent claudication in whom there is no evidence of tissue necrosis or rest pain. This review summarises the evidence from 8 pivotal trials of cilostazol involving over 2000 patients with intermittent claudication treated for up to 6 months.

To illuminate the controversy on alpha 1A- or alpha 1L-adrenoceptor involvement in noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat small mesenteric artery (SMA), we have studied the effects of subtype-selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists under different experimental conditions. 2. The agonist potency order in rat SMA was: A61603 > > SKF89748-A > cirazoline > noradrenaline > ST-587 > methoxamine. Prazosin antagonized all agonists with a low potency (pA2: 8.29-8.80) indicating the involvement of alpha 1L-rather than alpha 1A-adrenoceptors. 3. The putative alpha 1L-adrenoceptor antagonist JTH-601, but not the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor antagonist chloroethylclonidine (10 microM) antagonized noradrenaline-induced contractions of SMA. The potency of the selective alpha 1D-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 against noradrenaline (pA2 = 6.16 + /- 0.13) and of the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist RS-17053 against noradrenaline (pKB = 8.35 + /- 0.10) and against the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor agonist A-61603 (pKB = 8.40 + /- 0.09) were too low to account for alpha 1D- and alpha 1A-adrenoceptor involvement. 4. The potency of RS-17053 (pKB/pA2 's = 7.72-8.46) was not affected by lowering temperature, changing experimental protocol or inducing myogenic tone via KCl or U46619. 5. Selective protection of a putative alpha 1A-adrenoceptor population against the irreversible action of phenoxybenzamine also failed to increase the potency of RS-17053 (pA2 = 8.25 + /- 0.06 against A61603). 6. Combined concentration-ratio analysis demonstrated that tamsulosin, which does not discriminate between alpha 1A- and alpha 1L-adrenoceptors, and RS-17053 competed for binding at the same site in the SMA. 7. In summary, data obtained in our experiments in rat SMA indicate that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contraction displays a distinct alpha 1L-adrenoceptor pharmacology. This study does not provide evidence for the hypothesis that alpha 1L-adrenoceptors represent an affinity state of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor in functional assays. Furthermore, there is no co-existing alpha 1A-adrenoceptor in the SMA.","answer":"[[\\"RS-17053\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha 1L-adrenoceptors\\"], [\\"BMY 7378\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"alpha 1D-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"JTH-601\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"alpha 1L-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"phenoxybenzamine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha 1A-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"chloroethylclonidine\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"alpha 1B-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"tamsulosin\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha 1L-adrenoceptors\\"], [\\"RS-17053\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"alpha 1A-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"A-61603\\", \\"AGONIST\\", \\"alpha 1A-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"Prazosin\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha 1A-adrenoceptors\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

A primary source of these overheads is the exhaustive classification of typically 10^4-10^5 regions per image. Given that most of these regions contain uninformative background, the detector designs seem extremely superfluous and inefficient. In contrast, biological vision systems leverage selective attention for fast and efficient object detection. Recent neuroscientific findings shedding new light on the mechanism behind selective attention allowed us to formulate a new hypothesis of object detection efficiency and subsequently introduce a new object detection paradigm. To that end, we leverage this knowledge to design a novel region proposal network and empirically show that it achieves high object detection performance on the COCO dataset. Moreover, the model uses two to three orders of magnitude fewer computations than state-of-the-art models and consequently achieves inference speeds exceeding 500 frames s, thereby making it possible to achieve object detection on embedded systems.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Selective visual attention plays an important role in human visual system. In real life, human visual system cannot handle all of the visual information captured by eyes on time. Selective visual attention filters the visual information and selects interesting one for further processing such as object detection. Inspired by this mechanism, we construct an object detection method which can speed up the object detection relative to the methods that search objects by using sliding window. This method firstly extracts saliency map from the origin image, and then gets the candidate detection area from the saliency map by adaptive thresholds. To detect object, we only need to search the candidate detection area with the deformable part model. Since the candidate detection area is much smaller than the whole image, we can speed up the object detection. We evaluate the detection performance of our approach on PASCAL 2008 dataset, INRIA person dataset and Caltech 101 dataset, and the results indicate that our method can speed up the detection without decline in detection accuracy.[2]: Robust sensing of the environment is fundamental for driver assistance systems performing safe maneuvers. While approaches to object detection have experienced tremendous improvements since the introduction and combination of region proposal and convolutional neural networks in one framework, the detection of distant objects occupying just a few pixels in images can be challenging though. The convolutional and pooling layers reduce the image information to feature maps; yet, relevant information may be lost through pooling and convolution for small objects. In order to address this challenge, a new approach to proposing regions is presented that extends the architecture of a region proposal network by incorporating priors to guide the proposals towards regions containing potential target objects. Moreover, inspired by the concept of saliency, a saliency-based prior is chosen to guide the RPN towards important regions in order to make efficient use of differences between objects and background in an unsupervised fashion. This allows the network not only to consider local information provided by the convolutional layers, but also to take into account global information provided by the saliency priors. Experimental results based on a distant vehicle dataset and different configurations including three priors show that the incorporation of saliency-inspired priors into a region proposal network can improve its performance significantly.[3]: In this paper we address the problem of unsupervised localization of objects in single images. Compared to previous state-of-the-art method our method is fully unsupervised in the sense that there is no prior instance level or category level information about the image. Furthermore, we treat each image individually and do not rely on any neighboring image similarity. We employ deep-learning based generation of saliency maps and region proposals to tackle this problem. First salient regions in the image are determined using an encoder decoder architecture. The resulting saliency map is matched with region proposals from a class agnostic region proposal network to roughly localize the candidate object regions. These regions are further refined based on the overlap and similarity ratios. Our experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset show that the method gets close to current state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy even though these make use of multiple frames. Furthermore, we created a more challenging and realistic dataset with multiple object categories and varying viewpoint and illumination conditions for evaluating the method's performance in real world scenarios.[4]: [5]: Discovering object classes from images in a fully unsupervised way is an intrinsically ambiguous task; saliency detection approaches however ease the burden on unsupervised learning. We develop an algorithm for simultaneously localizing objects and discovering object classes via bottom-up (saliency-guided) multiple class learning (bMCL), and make the following contributions: (1) saliency detection is adopted to convert unsupervised learning into multiple instance learning, formulated as bottom-up multiple class learning (bMCL); (2) we utilize the Discriminative EM (DiscEM) to solve our bMCL problem and show DiscEM's connection to the MIL-Boost method[34]; (3) localizing objects, discovering object classes, and training object detectors are performed simultaneously in an integrated framework; (4) significant improvements over the existing methods for multi-class object discovery are observed. In addition, we show single class localization as a special case in our bMCL framework and we also demonstrate the advantage of bMCL over purely data-driven saliency methods.[6]:","answer":"Inspired by the promise of better region proposal efficiency in natural vision, researchers used saliency-based models to generate object-only region proposals for object detection [6] [2] [1] [4] [5] . Their main motivation was that a saliency map, generated non-exhaustively, could highlight regions containing objects, which can then be proposed to an object-category classifier, thereby ignoring background regions altogether and potentially saving thousands of unnecessary classifications. Nevertheless, a primary shortcoming of these previous attempts is that most models used high-resolution color ( @math pixels; RGB [2] ) images, which results in the overall detection model still being more computationally expensive and resource demanding than state-of-the-art one- and two-stage detectors. Furthermore, other studies ( [3] ) used saliency models trained on human eye fixations. A problem with this approach is that not all objects of interest are detected; just objects that grab human attention, which is inadequate for general object detection."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

Based on this text corpus, a topic model was first constructed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For a subsample of 503 songs, scores for predicting perceived musical hardness/heaviness and darkness/gloominess were extracted using audio feature models. By combining both audio feature and text analysis, we (1) offer a comprehensive overview of the lyrical topics present within the metal genre and (2) are able to establish whether or not levels of hardness and other music dimensions are associated with the occurrence of particularly harsh (and other) textual topics. Twenty typical topics were identified and projected into a topic space using multidimensional scaling (MDS). After Bonferroni correction, positive correlations were found between musical hardness and darkness and textual topics dealing with 'brutal death', 'dystopia', 'archaisms and occultism', 'religion and satanism', 'battle' and '(psychological) madness', while there is a negative associations with topics like 'personal life' and 'love and romance'.IntroductionAs audio and text features provide complementary layers of information on songs, a combination of both data types has been shown to improve the automatic classification of high-level attributes in music such as genre, mood and emotion BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3. Multi-modal approaches interlinking these features offer insights into possible relations between lyrical and musical information (see BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6).In the case of metal music, sound dimensions like loudness, distortion and particularly hardness (or heaviness) play an essential role in defining the sound of this genre BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. Specific subgenres – especially doom metal, gothic metal and black metal – are further associated with a sound that is often described as dark or gloomy BIBREF11, BIBREF12.These characteristics are typically not limited to the acoustic and musical level. In a research strand that has so far been generally treated separately from the audio dimensions, lyrics from the metal genre have come under relatively close scrutiny (cf. BIBREF13). Topics typically ascribed to metal lyrics include sadness, death, freedom, nature, occultism or unpleasant/disgusting objects and are overall characterized as harsh, gloomy, dystopian, or satanic BIBREF14, BIBREF13, BIBREF15, BIBREF16, BIBREF17.Until now, investigations on metal lyrics were limited to individual cases or relatively small corpora – with a maximum of 1,152 songs in BIBREF17. Besides this, the relation between the musical and the textual domain has not yet been explored. Therefore, we examine a large corpus of metal song lyrics, addressing the following questions:Which topics are present within the corpus of metal lyrics?Is there a connection between characteristic musical dimensions like hardness and darkness and certain topics occurring within the textual domain?MethodologyIn our sequential research design, the distribution of textual topics within the corpus was analyzed using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This resulted in a topic model, which was used for a probabilistic assignment of topics to each of the song documents. Additionally, for a subset of these songs, audio features were extracted using models for high-level music dimensions. The use of automatic models for the extraction of both text as well as musical features allows for scalability as it enables a large corpus to be studied without depending on the process of manual annotation for each of the songs. The resulting feature vectors were then subjected to a correlation analysis. Figure FIGREF6 outlines the sequence of the steps taken in processing the data. The individual steps are explained in the following subsections.Methodology ::: Text Corpus Creation and CleaningFor gathering the data corpus, a web crawler was programmed using the Python packages Requests and BeautifulSoup. In total, 152,916 metal music lyrics were extracted from www.darklyrics.com.Using Python’s langdetect package, all non-English texts were excluded. With the help of regular expressions, the texts were scanned for tokens indicating meta-information, which is not part of the actual lyrics. To this end, a list of stopwords referring to musical instruments or the production process (e.g. ‘recorded’, ‘mixed’, ‘arrangement by’, ‘band photos’) was defined in addition to common stopwords. After these cleaning procedures, 124,288 texts remained in the subsample. For text normalization, stemming and lemmatization were applied as further preprocessing steps.Methodology ::: Topic Modelling via Latent Dirichlet AllocationWe performed a LDA BIBREF18 on the remaining subsample to construct a probabilistic topic model. The LDA models were created by using the Python library Gensim BIBREF19. The lyrics were first converted to a bag-of-words format, and standard weighting of terms provided by the Gensim package was applied.Log perplexity BIBREF20 and log UMass coherence BIBREF21 were calculated as goodness-of-fit measures evaluating topic models ranging from 10 to 100 topics. Considering these performance measures as well as qualitative interpretability of the resulting topic models, we chose a topic model including 20 topics – an approach comparable with BIBREF22. We then examined the most salient and most typical words for each topic.Moreover, we used the ldavis package to analyze the structure of the resulting topic space BIBREF23. In order to do so, the Jensen-Shannon divergence between topics was calculated in a first step. In a second step, we applied multidimensional scaling (MDS) to project the inter-topic distances onto a two-dimensional plane. MDS is based on the idea of calculating dissimilarities between pairs of items of an input matrix while minimizing the strain function BIBREF24. In this case, the closer the topics are located to one another on the two-dimensional plane, the more they share salient terms and the more likely a combination of these topics appear in a song.Methodology ::: High-Level Audio Feature ExtractionThe high-level audio feature models used had been constructed in previous examinations BIBREF25, BIBREF26. In those music perception studies, ratings were obtained for 212 music stimuli in an online listening experiment by 40 raters.2Based on this ground truth, prediction models for the automatic extraction of high-level music dimensions – including the concepts of perceived hardness/heaviness and darkness/gloominess in music – had been trained using machine learning methods. In a second step, the model obtained for hardness had been evaluated using further listening experiments on a new unseen set of audio stimuli BIBREF26. The model has been refined against this backdrop, resulting in an R^2 value of 0.80 for hardness/heaviness and 0.60 for darkness/gloominess using five-fold cross-validation.The resulting models embedded features implemented in LibROSA BIBREF27, Essentia BIBREF28 as well as the timbral models developed as part of the AudioCommons project BIBREF29.Methodology ::: Investigating the Connection between Audio and Text FeaturesFinally, we drew a random sample of 503 songs and used Spearman's rho  to identify correlations between the topics retrieved and the audio dimensions obtained by the high-level audio feature models. We opted for Spearman’s rho  since it does not assume normal distribution of the data, is less prone to outliers and zero-inflation than Pearson’s r. Bonferroni correction was applied in order to account for multiple-testing.Results ::: Textual TopicsTable TABREF10 displays the twenty resulting topics found within the text corpus using LDA. The topics are numbered in descending order according to their prevalence (weight) in the text corpus. For each topic, a qualitative interpretation is given along with the 10 most salient terms.The salient terms of the first topic – and in parts also the second – appear relatively generic, as terms like e.g. ‘know’, ‘never’, and ‘time’ occur in many contexts. However, the majority of the remaining topics reveal distinct lyrical themes described as being characteristic for the metal genre. ‘Religion & satanism’ (topic #5) and descriptions of ‘brutal death’ (topic #7) can be considered as being typical for black metal and death metal respectively, whereas ‘battle’ (topic #6), ‘landscape & journey’ (topic #11), ‘struggle for freedom’ (topic #12), and ‘dystopia’ (topic #15), are associated with power metal and other metal subgenres.2This is highlighted in detail in Figure FIGREF11. Here, the topic distributions for two exemplary bands contained within the sample are presented. For these heat maps, data has been aggregated over individual songs showing the topic distribution at the level of albums over a band’s history. The examples chosen illustrate the dependence between textual topics and musical subgenres. For the band Manowar, which is associated with the genre of heavy metal, power metal or true metal, a prevalence of topic #6 (‘battle’) can be observed, while a distinctive prevalence of topic #7 (‘brutal death’) becomes apparent for Cannibal Corpse – a band belonging to the subgenre of death metal.Within the topic configuration obtained via multidimensional scaling (see Figure FIGREF12), two latent dimensions can be identified. The first dimension (PC1) distinguishes topics with more common wordings on the right hand side from topics with less common wording on the left hand side. This also correlates with the weight of the topics within the corpus. The second dimension (PC2) is characterized by an contrast between transcendent and sinister topics dealing with occultism, metaphysics, satanism, darkness, and mourning (#9, #3, .#5, #13, and #16) at the top and comparatively shallow content dealing with personal life and Rock’n’Roll lifestyle using a rather mundane or vulgar vocabulary (#1, #8, and #19) at the bottom. This contrast can be interpreted as ‘otherworldliness / individual-transcending narratives’ vs. ‘worldliness / personal life’.Results ::: Correlations with Musical DimensionsIn the final step of our analysis, we calculated the association between the twenty topics discussed above and the two high-level audio features hardness and darkness using Spearman’s rho . The results are visualized in Figure FIGREF13 and the rho  values listed in table TABREF10.Significant positive associations can be observed between musical hardness and the topics ‘brutal death’, ‘dystopia’, ‘archaisms & occultism’, ‘religion & satanism’, and ‘battle’, while it is negatively linked to relatively mundane topics concerning ‘personal life’ and ‘love & romance’. The situation is similar for dark/gloomy sounding music, which in turn is specifically related to themes such as ‘dystopia’ and ‘(psychological) madness’. Overall, the strength of the associations is moderate at best, with a tendency towards higher associations for hardness than darkness. The strongest association exists between hardness and the topic ‘brutal death’ (rho = 0.267, p < 0.01).Conclusion and OutlookApplying the example of metal music, our work examined the textual topics found in song lyrics and investigated the association between these topics and high-level music features. By using LDA and MDS in order to explore prevalent topics and the topic space, typical text topics identified in qualitative analyses could be confirmed and objectified based on a large text corpus. These include e.g. satanism, dystopia or disgusting objects. It was shown that musical hardness is particularly associated with harsh topics like ‘brutal death’ and ‘dystopia’, while it is negatively linked to relatively mundane topics concerning personal life and love. We expect that even stronger correlations could be found for metal-specific topics when including more genres covering a wider range of hardness/darkness values.Therefore, we suggest transferring the method to a sample including multiple genres. Moreover, an integration with metadata such as genre information would allow for the testing of associations between topics, genres and high-level audio features. This could help to better understand the role of different domains in an overall perception of genre-defining attributes such as hardness.Figure 1: Processing steps of the approach illustrating the parallel analysis of text and audio featuresTable 1: Overview of the resulting topics found within the corpus of metal lyrics (n = 124,288) and their correlation to the dimensions hardness and darkness obtained from the audio signal (see section 3.2)Figure 2: Comparison of the topic distributions for all included albums by the bands Manowar and Cannibal Corpse showing a prevalence of the topics ‘battle’ and ‘brutal death’ respectivelyFigure 3: Topic configuration obtained via multidimensional scaling.

BID1 , and perception BID7 Florensa et al., 2018a ).Yet, most work in RL is still learning a new behavior from scratch when faced with a new problem.This is particularly inefficient when dealing with tasks that are hard to solve due to sparse rewards or long horizons, or when solving many related tasks.A promising technique to overcome this limitation is Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) BID17 Florensa et al., 2017a) .In this paradigm, policies have several modules of abstraction, so the reuse of a subset of the modules becomes easier.The most common case consists of temporal abstraction BID9 Dayan & Hinton, 1993 ), where a higher-level policy (manager) takes actions at a lower frequency, and its actions condition the behavior of some lower level skills or sub-policies.When transferring knowledge to a new task, most prior works fix the skills and train a new manager on top.Despite having a clear benefit in kick-starting the learning in the new task, having fixed skills can considerably cap the final performance on the new task (Florensa et al., 2017a) .Little work has been done on adapting pre-trained sub-policies to be optimal for a new task.In this paper, we develop a new framework for adapting all levels of temporal hierarchies simultaneously.First, we derive an efficient approximated hierarchical policy gradient.Our key insight is that, under mild assumptions, the manager's decisions can be considered part of the observation from the perspective of the sub-policies.This decouples the gradient with respect to the manager and the sub-policies parameters and provides theoretical justification for a technique used in other prior works (Frans et al., 2018) .Second, we introduce an unbiased sub-policy specific baseline for our hierarchical policy gradient.Our experiments reveal faster convergence, suggesting efficient gradient variance reduction.Then we introduce a more stable way of using this gradient, Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HiPPO).This helps us take more conservative steps in our policy space BID12 , necessary in hierarchies because of the interdependence of each layer.Finally we also evaluate the benefit of varying the time-commitment to the sub-policies, and show it helps both in terms of final performance and zero-shot adaptation to similar tasks.In this paper, we examined how to effectively adapt hierarchical policies.We began by deriving a hierarchical policy gradient and approximation of it.We then proposed a new method, HiPPO, that can stably train multiple layers of a hierarchy.The adaptation experiments suggested that we can optimize pretrained skills for downstream environments, and learn emergent skills without any unsupervised pre-training.We also explored hierarchy from an information bottleneck point of view, demonstrating that HiPPO with randomized period can learn from scratch on sparsereward and long time horizon tasks, while outperforming non-hierarchical methods on zero-shot transfer.There are many enticing avenues of future work.For instance, replacing the manually designed bottleneck with a variational autoencoder with an information bottleneck could further improve HiPPO's performance and extend the gains seen here to other tasks.Also, as HiPPO provides a policy architecture and gradient expression, we could explore using meta-learning on top of it in order to learn better skills that are more useful on a distribution of different tasks.","answer":"We propose HiPPO, a stable Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning algorithm that can train several levels of the hierarchy simultaneously, giving good performance both in skill discovery and adaptation."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Here we report an alternative strategy utilized by an omnivorous marine worm, Hediste diversicolor, to supplement its diet: gardening by sprouting seeds. In addition to having many other known feeding modes, we showed using video recordings and manipulative mesocosm experiments that this species can also behave like gardeners by deliberately burying cordgrass seeds in their burrows, which has been previously shown to reduce the loss of seeds to water. These seeds, however, are protected by the seed husk, and we used feeding experiments to show that they were not edible for H. diversicolor until they had sprouted or the seed husk had been artificially removed. Additionally, sprouts were shown to be highly nutritious, permitting higher growth rates in H. diversicolor than the low - quality basal food, detritus. We propose both a proximate cause (seed husk as a physical barrier) and ultimate cause (nutritional demand) for this peculiar feeding behavior. Our findings suggest that sprouting may be a common strategy used by seed - collecting animals to exploit nutrients from well-protected seeds.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"sprouting\\", \\"Sprouting\\", \\"sprouted\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"water\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"omnivorous marine worm\\", \\"seed\\", \\"animals\\", \\"algal crops\\", \\"seeds\\", \\"H. diversicolor\\", \\"fungal\\", \\"Hediste diversicolor\\", \\"marine worm\\", \\"seed husk\\", \\"sprouts\\", \\"non-human animals\\", \\"cordgrass\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"not edible\\", \\"demand\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"basal food\\", \\"food\\", \\"staple food\\", \\"supplement its diet\\", \\"nutritious\\", \\"nutrients\\", \\"supplementary food\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"species\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"gardeners\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"experiments\\", \\"manipulative mesocosm experiments\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"superior\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

level coupled to a simple harmonic oscillator has been of interest for more than 30 years , at least since the work of cohen - tannoudji et al @xcite .the hamiltonian for this problem can be written as    @xmath0    where we can write the spin operators @xmath1 in terms of the pauli matrices as    @xmath2    this model has been of interest recently in problems in which atoms interact with strong electromagnetic fields .we have become interested in this problem since it can exhibit coherent energy coupling between systems with characteristic energies that are very different . the multiphoton regimein which @xmath3 in this regard is of interest to us .additionally , our focus has been on the large @xmath4 limit .it is well known that the dipolar interaction between photons and atoms causes the frequency of the atom to get shifted .the associated shift has been termed the bloch - siegert shift in the literature @xcite .a general analytic expression for the @xmath5th resonance has been known for some time @xcite .measurements of this shift have been reported recently up to @xmath6 @xcite .various theoretical methods have been used to understand these results @xcite .we have recently found a unitary transformation that separates the problem into three parts , each of which is relatively complicated . in the multiphoton regimewe view the largest of these as an \`\` unperturbed '' dressed hamiltonian , which we have found give energy eigenvalues that are close to those of the original problem away from the level anticrossings . in the present work ,our attention is drawn to this aspect of the problem . using this approach , we are able to develop a reasonably good estimate of the bloch - siegert shift using a simple variational approximation , one which we can compare with results obtained using other methods .as mentioned above , we have found it helpful to work in a rotated frame . instead of considering the hamiltonian in equation  ( [ eq : basichamiltonian ] ), we consider the unitary equivalent hamiltonian    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is    @xmath9    the operator @xmath8 depends explicitly on @xmath10 .this rotation can be carried out explicitly , leading to a complicated expression .it is useful to write the rotated hamiltonian in the form    @xmath11    where we have defined @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 according to    @xmath15    @xmath16 ^ 2   } right ] ( hat{a}-hat{a}^dagger ) + ( hat{a}-hat{a}^dagger ) left [ { displaystyle {   uover delta e }   over 1 +    left [ displaystyle { 2 u   ( hat{a}+hat{a}^dagger ) over delta e } right ] ^2   } right ] right rbrace left ( { 2hat{s}_y over hbar } right )  ] ]    @xmath17 ^ 2   }   right rbrace^2 ] ]    even though this rotated hamiltonian is much more complicated than the one we started out with , we have found that it has useful properties that are of interest .for example , from numerical calculations and also from the wkb approximation , we have found that the \`\` unperturbed '' part of the hamiltonian @xmath12 is a good approximation to the initial hamiltonian @xmath18 away from level anticrossings .the \`\` perturbation '' @xmath13 contains the part of the hamiltonian that is most responsible for level splitting at the anti - crossing ( as we will discuss elsewhere ) .finally , the remaining term @xmath14 gives rise to a minor correction to @xmath12 .to illustrate the usefulness of this rotation , we focus on one issue in particular : the development of an interesting approximation for the energy eigenvalues . for this , we need focus only on @xmath12 .consider the time - independent schrdinger equation for the \`\` unperturbed '' part of the rotated problem    @xmath19    because @xmath12 is somewhat complicated , it is not straightforward to develop exact analytic solutions .we have used numerical solutions to develop some understanding of the eigenfunctions and associated eigenvalues . from these numerical studies ,it has become clear that there exists a useful analytic approximation .we adopt an approximate solution of the form    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a pure sho eigenstate , and @xmath22 is a spin function . the variational estimate for the energy eigenvalue in this approximationis    @xmath23    this approximate energy can be evaluated explicitly to give    @xmath24    this result is interesting in that it leads directly to a simple interpretation of the system in terms of a dressed two - level system and unperturbed oscillator , which is reasonably good away from the level anticrossings . moreover , the dressed two - level system energy is involved in the calculation of the bloch - siegert shift in the literature .let us write the variational energy as    @xmath25    where we define @xmath26 according to    @xmath27    and @xmath28 as    @xmath29    this approximation is very good , as can be seen in figure  [ fig32x1 ] where the approximation is plotted along with the exact numerical results .the bloch -

BACKGROUND: Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has been used for many years in the treatment of human lymphatic filariasis. Its mode of action is not well understood, but it is known to interact with the arachidonic acid pathway. Here we have investigated the contribution of the nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways to the activity of DEC against B. malayi microfilariae in mice. METHODS: B. malayi microfilariae were injected intravenously into mice and parasitaemia was measured 24 hours later. DEC was then administered to BALB/c mice with and without pre-treatment with indomethacin or dexamethasone and the parasitaemia monitored. To investigate a role for inducible nitric oxide in DEC 's activity, DEC and ivermectin were administered to microfilaraemic iNOS-/- mice and their background strain (129/SV). Western blot analysis was used to determine any effect of DEC on the production of COX and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins. RESULTS: DEC administered alone to BALB/c mice resulted in a rapid and profound reduction in circulating microfilariae within five minutes of treatment. Microfilarial levels began to recover after 24 hours and returned to near pre-treatment levels two weeks later, suggesting that the sequestration of microfilariae occurs independently of parasite killing. Pre-treatment of animals with dexamethasone or indomethacin reduced DEC 's efficacy by almost 90% or 56%, respectively, supporting a role for the arachidonic acid and cyclooxygenase pathways in vivo. Furthermore, experiments showed that treatment with DEC results in a reduction in the amount of COX-1 protein in peritoneal exudate cells. Additionally, in iNOS-/- mice infected with B. malayi microfilariae, DEC showed no activity, whereas the efficacy of another antifilarial drug, ivermectin, was unaffected. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the important role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in DEC 's mechanism of action in vivo and show that in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, it targets the cyclooxygenase pathway and COX-1. Moreover, we show for the first time that inducible nitric oxide is essential for the rapid sequestration of microfilariae by DEC.","answer":"[[\\"DEC\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"DEC\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"COX\\"], [\\"indomethacin\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"cyclooxygenase\\"], [\\"Diethylcarbamazine\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"cyclooxygenase\\"], [\\"dexamethasone\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"cyclooxygenase\\"], [\\"DEC\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"nitric-oxide synthase\\"], [\\"DEC\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"COX-1\\"], [\\"Diethylcarbamazine\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"inducible nitric-oxide synthase\\"], [\\"DEC\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"cyclooxygenase\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Progress in defining the ion channel function of GluDs in neurons has been hindered by a lack of pharmacological tools. Here, we used a chemo-genetic approach to engineer specific and photo-reversible pharmacology in GluD2 receptor. We incorporated a cysteine mutation in the cavity located above the putative ion channel pore, for site-specific conjugation with a photoswitchable pore blocker. In the constitutively open GluD2 Lurcher mutant, current could be rapidly and reversibly decreased with light. We then transposed the cysteine mutation to the native receptor, to demonstrate with high pharmacological specificity that metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling triggers opening of GluD2. Our results assess the functional relevance of GluD2 ion channel and introduce an optogenetic tool that will provide a novel and powerful means for probing GluD2 ionotropic contribution to neuronal physiology.Introduction:The delta glutamate receptors, GluD1 and GluD2, belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor( iGluR) family, yet they don’t bind glutamate( Yuzaki and Aricescu, 2017). They are considered as glutamate receptors solely based on their strong sequence and structure homology with AMPA, NMDA and kainate receptors( Lomeli et al., 1993; Araki et al., 1993; Schmid and Hollmann, 2008; Elegheert et al., 2016; Burada et al., 2020a; Burada et al., 2020b). GluD receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain, GluD1 predominantly in the forebrain, while GluD2 is highly enriched in cerebellar Purkinje cells( PCs)( Konno et al., 2014; Hepp et al., 2015; Nakamoto et al., 2020b). Both GluD1 and GluD2 play a role in the formation, stabilization, function and plasticity of synapses through their interaction with members of the cerebellin( Cbln) family( Fossati et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2018; Matsuda et al., 2010; Kakegawa et al., 2008). Cbln1 notably binds both the N-terminal domain of postsynaptic GluD2 and presynaptic neurexins, leading to a trans-synaptic bridge that promotes synaptogenesis and is essential for GluD2 signaling in vivo( Elegheert et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2020). Deletion of genes coding for GluD1 or GluD2 in mouse results in marked behavioral alterations( Yadav et al., 2012; Lalouette et al., 2001; Yadav et al., 2013; Nakamoto et al., 2020a), and mutations in these genes in humans have been associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases( Griswold et al., 2012; Treutlein et al., 2009; Greenwood et al., 2011; Cristino, 2019), attesting to their functional importance in brain circuits. Despite their structural similarity with other iGluRs, and notably the presence of a ligand-binding domain( LBD), GluDs stand out because they are not activated by glutamate( Araki et al., 1993; Lomeli et al., 1993). Nonetheless, recent studies revealed that GluD pore opening could be triggered indirectly, through the activation of Gq-coupled metabotropic receptors, and contributes to neurotransmission and neuronal excitability( Ady et al., 2014; Dadak et al., 2017; Benamer et al., 2018; Gantz et al., 2020). Indeed, the activation of GluD channels triggered by metabotropic glutamate receptors( mGlu1/5) underlies the slow excitatory postsynaptic current in cerebellar PCs( GluD2, Ady et al., 2014) and in midbrain dopaminergic neurons( GluD1, Benamer et al., 2018). Moreover, the demonstration that GluD1 channels carry the noradrenergic slow excitatory current in dorsal raphe neurons( Gantz et al., 2020), suggests that the contribution of GluD channels to neuronal excitability and synaptic physiology may be widespread. The above studies relied largely on genetic tools, such as dead-pore mutants or targeted deletions, to assess the ion channel function of GluDs. Yet, due to the absence of specific pharmacological tools to block their ion permeation, the role of GluD1/2 channels in the regulation of neural activity remains largely elusive. Pore blockers for GluDs, such as pentamidine and 1-Naphthyl acetyl spermine( NASPM), were previously identified using a point mutation( A654T) in GluD2 that confers constitutive ion flow and causes the degeneration of cerebellar PCs in Lurcher( GluD2Lc) mice( Wollmuth et al., 2000; Zuo et al., 1997). These molecules are however also pore blockers of NMDA and AMPA receptors, respectively. Other ligands such as D-serine and glycine bind to the LBD and reduce spontaneous currents in GluD2Lc, which suggests a coupling between the LBD and the channel( Naur et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2009), but these molecules have broad spectrum activity. Finally, 7-chlorokynurenic acid has been identified to modulate GluD2Lc current by binding to the D-serine site but it is also a GluN1 competitive antagonist( Kristensen et al., 2016). To fill this gap, we bestowed light-sensitivity to the GluD ion channel pore using a photoswitchable tethered ligand( PTL) approach( Paoletti et al., 2019; Mondoloni et al., 2019). Using structure-based design, we incorporated a cysteine point mutation at the surface of GluD2, right above the hypothetical channel lumen, onto which can be anchored a photoswitchable pore blocker. Different wavelengths of light are then used to modify the geometry of the PTL, thereby presenting/removing the blocker to/from the channel, resulting in optical control of ionotropic activity. Here we demonstrate rapid and reversible, optical control of ion current through a cysteine-substituted GluD2 receptor. This novel tool, called light-controllable GluD2( LiGluD2), allows rapid, reversible and pharmacologically-specific control of ionic current through GluD2, and may help provide a mechanistic understanding of how this receptor contributes to brain circuit function and behaviors.Discussion:The PTL strategy has been successfully applied to several members of the iGluR family, including kainate( Volgraf et al., 2006) and NMDA( Berlin et al., 2016) receptors. In these former studies, the photoswitches were made with a glutamate head group, and were tethered to the LBD in proximity to the glutamate binding pocket, providing photocontrol of channel gating( Reiner et al., 2015). Because their activation mechanism is still unknown, we adopted a different strategy for photocontrolling GluD receptors. We installed the photoswitchable ligand MAGu in proximity to the pore lumen, in hope to alter ion conduction through non-competitive antagonism. We found several cysteine mutants for which current was specifically modulated by light after attachment of MAGu, notably I677C( a. k. a. LiGluD2). In LiGluD2, trans MAGu likely does not reach the pore lumen as originally designed. Nevertheless, it reversibly modulates current through the open GluD2 channel with high temporal and pharmacological precision. The compounds traditionally used to probe the ionic function of GluDs, such as pentamidine and NASPM( Kohda et al., 2000; Williams et al., 2003), are not specific of GluD and also block NMDA and AMPA receptors. As to D-serine and glycine, they partially inhibit GluD2Lc and mGlu1-gated GluD currents( Naur et al., 2007; Ady et al., 2014; Benamer et al., 2018), but they are also co-agonists of NMDA receptors. Here, the pharmacological specificity of LiGluD2 is exquisite: after MAGu treatment, only the I677C mutant, and not the WT receptor, became sensitive to light. Likewise, MAGu did not photosensitize other WT glutamate receptors expressed in native brain tissue, in agreement with previous report demonstrating that MAGu has no off-target effects on WT GABA receptors, glutamate receptors and voltage-gated ion channels( Lin et al., 2015). Indeed, even though the maleimide group of MAGu reacts in principle with any extracellular cysteine freely accessible on the cell surface, the ability of the tethered ligand( here guanidinium) to reach a particular site of action on any given protein in one configuration, but not the other( e. g. trans but not cis), is highly improbable. In fact, the PTL approach has already demonstrated exquisite pharmacological specificity for a large variety of cysteine-substituted ion channels and receptors( Paoletti et al., 2019; Mondoloni et al., 2019), even in complex biological settings such as brain slices( Berlin et al., 2016) or intact neuronal circuits in vivo( Lin et al., 2015; Durand-de Cuttoli et al., 2018). Attachment of MAGu to GluD2 requires a single amino acid substitution, which is unlikely to disrupt the function of the receptor. In line with this, we found that the functional coupling of GluD2 with mGlu1 signaling( Ady et al., 2014; Dadak et al., 2017) was intact in LiGluD2. This enabled us to validate that activation of mGlu1 triggers the opening of the GluD2 channel in heterologous expression system, in support of earlier evidence that opening of the ion channel of GluD receptors can be triggered in response to metabotropic signaling mechanisms( Ady et al., 2014; Dadak et al., 2017; Benamer et al., 2018; Gantz et al., 2020). Even though light-induced blockade in LiGluD2 is partial, the rapid kinetics of block/unblock, coupled to the genetic specificity of the methodology, provide a unique opportunity to detect even small variations in GluD2 current, such as the tonic current we observed in heterologous expression system. LiGluD2 remains to be deployed in neuronal setting, yet we believe it will be a crucial tool for probing the ionotropic contribution of this orphan receptor to synaptic physiology.","answer":"Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by the body that trigger activity in neurons .

In factor analysis, the observations are modeled as a linear combination of normally distributed hidden variables. We describe a nonlinear generalization of factor analysis, called 'product analy-sis', that models the observed variables as a linear combination of products of normally distributed hidden variables. Just as factor analysis can be viewed as unsupervised linear regression on unobserved, normally distributed hidden variables, product analysis can be viewed as unsupervised linear regression on products of unobserved, normally distributed hidden variables. The mapping between the data and the hidden space is nonlinear, so we use an approximate variational technique for inference and learning. Since product analysis is a generalization of factor analysis, product analysis always finds a higher data likelihood than factor analysis. We give results on pattern recognition and illumination-invariant image clustering.","answer":"[[\\"Factor analysis\\", \\"linear relationships between observed variables\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"principal components analysis\\", \\"linear relationships between observed variables\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"Factor analysis\\", \\"principal components analysis\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"linear combination of products of normally distributed hidden variables\\", \\"nonlinear generalization of factor analysis\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"u0027product analy-sisu0027\\", \\"generalization of factor analysis\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"u0027product analy-sisu0027\\", \\"Factor analysis\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"nonlinear generalization of factor analysis\\", \\"observed variables\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"unsupervised linear regression\\", \\"Factor analysis\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"u0027product analy-sisu0027\\", \\"nonlinear generalization of factor analysis\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"approximate variational technique\\", \\"learning\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"approximate variational technique\\", \\"inference\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"unsupervised linear regression\\", \\"u0027product analy-sisu0027\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"inference\\", \\"learning\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"pattern recognition\\", \\"illumination-invariant image clustering\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Ibuprofen caused a significant reduction of headache (p = 0.008), earache (p = 0.01), muscle/joint pain (p = 0.045), and reduced body temperature (p = 0.02). There was a 40% reduction in the number of sneezes (p = 0.02) and a 33% reduction in the symptom score for sneezing (p = 0.04). This study did not detect any effect on other nasal symptoms.Title 2:Adverse effects of aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen on immune function, viral shedding, and clinical status in rhinovirus-infected volunteers.Abstract 2:A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to study the effects of over-the-counter analgesic/antipyretic medications on virus shedding, immune response, and clinical status in the common cold. Sixty healthy volunteers were challenged intranasally with rhinovirus type 2 and randomized to one of four treatment arms: aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or placebo. Fifty-six volunteers were successfully infected and shed virus on at least 4 days after challenge. Virus shedding, antibody levels, clinical symptoms and signs, and blood leukocyte levels were carefully monitored. Use of aspirin and acetaminophen was associated with suppression of serum neutralizing antibody response (P less than .05 vs. placebo) and increased nasal symptoms and signs (P less than .05 vs. placebo). A concomitant rise in circulating monocytes suggested that the suppression of antibody response may be mediated through drug effects on monocytes and/or mononuclear phagocytes. There were no significant differences in viral shedding among the four groups, but a trend toward longer duration of virus shedding was observed in the aspirin and acetaminophen groups.Title 3:Influence of loxoprofen use on recovery from naturally acquired upper respiratory tract infections: a randomized controlled trial.Abstract 3:To investigate whether loxoprofen, one of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prolongs the recovery process of naturally acquired upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in the clinical setting.                A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 23 outpatient facilities in Japan. Patients aged 18 through 65 years suffering from URTIs were randomly assigned to receive loxoprofen or its placebo. The primary outcome was duration of illness in days.                A total of 174 patients were available for the analyses. Duration of illness was 8.94 +/- 3.20 days in the loxoprofen group compared to 8.39 +/- 3.39 days in the placebo group (P=.19). The number of days with limited daily activities was fewer in the loxoprofen group than in the placebo group (2.12 +/- 2.05 days vs. 2.68 +/- 2.54 days, P=.17). Although severe symptoms were less frequent on days 1, 2, and 3 in the loxoprofen group (27%, 33%, and 29%, respectively) than in the placebo group (32%, 39%, and 37%, respectively), symptoms were more frequent on days 6 through 12 in the loxoprofen group (difference, 5-13%). Adverse events were more common in the loxoprofen group (9.5% vs. 1.1%, P=.051).                Loxoprofen did not significantly modify the recovery process of URTIs except for a slight tendency to delay.Title 4:Effects of naproxen on experimental rhinovirus colds. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.Abstract 4:To determine whether naproxen, a propionic acid inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, alters the course of experimental rhinovirus colds.                A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.                Rhinovirus challenge model in volunteers cloistered in individual hotel rooms.                Eighty-seven healthy young adults with serum neutralizing antibody titers of less than or equal to 1:2 to the challenge virus; 79 were evaluable.                Thirty-nine participants received naproxen (loading dose, 400 mg or 500 mg followed by 200 mg or 500 mg three times daily for 5 days). Forty participants received placebo. Treatment was started 6 hours after viral challenge.                Daily measurement of viral titers, symptoms, nasal mucus production, and nasal tissue use; incidence of infection and illness; and measurement of homotypic serum neutralizing antibody responses.                Viral titers and serum homotypic antibody responses were similar in the naproxen and placebo groups. Significant reductions in headache, malaise, myalgia, and cough occurred in the naproxen group. A 29% reduction was noted in the total (5-day) symptom score in the naproxen group (95% CI, 16% to 42%).                Naproxen treatment did not alter virus shedding or serum neutralizing antibody responses in participants with experimental rhinovirus colds, but it had a beneficial effect on the symptoms of headache, malaise, myalgia, and cough. Prostaglandins may be among the inflammatory mediators that play a role in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds.Title 5:Evaluation of an alpha agonist alone and in combination with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent in the treatment of experimental rhinovirus colds.Abstract 5:The pathogenesis of symptoms of the common cold and their optimal treatment are incompletely understood. To evaluate the role of an oral alpha agonist alone and in combination with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of experimental rhinovirus colds, 58 subjects were randomized to receive pseudoephedrine 60 mg alone, pseudoephedrine 60 mg plus ibuprofen 200 mg, or placebo, four times daily for 4 1/2 days beginning 30 hours after intranasal rhinovirus inoculation under double-blind conditions. The frequencies of infection, colds occurrence, and viral shedding did not differ significantly between the groups. Total symptom scores were reduced by 59% by pseudoephedrine plus ibuprofen (p less than 0.05) and 48% by pseudoephedrine alone compared with placebo. Nasal symptom scores tended to be lower in recipients of pseudoephedrine plus ibuprofen compared with pseudoephedrine alone (p = 0.09), but other parameters showed no significant treatment differences between the groups. Rhinorrhea, as determined by nasal secretion weights, was significantly reduced in both treatment groups compared to placebo.

We develop short-channel transistors using solution-processed single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to evaluate the feasibility of those SWNTs for high-performance applications. Our results show that even though the intrinsic field-effect mobility is lower than the mobility of CVD nanotubes, the electrical contact between the nanotube and metal electrodes is not significantly affected. It is this contact resistance which often limits the performance of ultrascaled transistors. Moreover, we found that the contact resistance is lowered by the introduction of oxygen treatment. Therefore, high-performance solution-processed nanotube transistors with a 15 nm channel length were obtained by combining a top-gate structure and gate insulators made of a high-dielectric-constant ZrO(2) film. The combination of these elements yields a performance comparable to that obtained with CVD nanotube transistors, which indicates the potential for using solution-processed SWNTs for future aggressively scaled transistor technology.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"carbon\\", \\"oxygen\\", \\"ZrO(2)\\"]}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Byenforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the input observations and the discriminator's internal representation, we can encourage the discriminator to learn a representation that has heavy overlap between the data and the generator's distribution, thereby effectively modulating the discriminator's accuracy and maintaining useful and informative gradients for the generator. Ourapproach to stabilizing adversarial learning can be viewed as an adaptive variant of instance noise BID39 . However, we show that the adaptive nature of this method is critical. Constrainingthe mutual information between the discriminator's internal representation and the input allows the regularizer to directly limit the discriminator's accuracy, which automates the choice of noise magnitude and applies this noise to a compressed representation of the input that is specifically optimized to model the most discerning differences between the generator and data distributions.The main contribution of this work is the variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB), an adaptive stochastic regularization method for adversarial learning that substantially improves performance across a range of different application domains, examples of which are available in FIG0 . Our method canbe easily applied to a variety of tasks and architectures. First, we evaluateour method on a suite of challenging imitation tasks, including learning highly acrobatic skills from mocap data with a simulated humanoid character. Our method also enablescharacters to learn dynamic continuous control skills directly from raw video demonstrations, and drastically improves upon previous work that uses adversarial imitation learning. We further evaluate theeffectiveness of the technique for inverse reinforcement learning, which recovers a reward function from demonstrations in order to train future policies. Finally, we apply our frameworkto image generation using generative adversarial networks, where employing VDB improves the performance in many cases.To interpret the effects of the VDB, we consider the results presented by , which show that for two distributions with disjoint support, the optimal discriminator can perfectly classify all samples and its gradients will be zero almost everywhere.Thus, as the discriminator converges to the optimum, the gradients for the generator vanishes accordingly.To address this issue, proposed applying continuous noise to the discriminator inputs, thereby ensuring that the distributions have continuous support everywhere.In practice, if the original distributions are sufficiently distant from each other, the added noise will have negligible effects.As shown by , the optimal choice for the variance of the noise to ensure convergence can be quite delicate.In our method, by first using a learned encoder to map the inputs to an embedding and then applying an information bottleneck on the embedding, we can dynamically adjust the variance of the noise such that the distributions not only share support in the embedding space, but also have significant overlap.Since the minimum amount of information required for binary classification is 1 bit, by selecting an information constraint I c < 1, the discriminator is prevented from from perfectly differentiating between the distributions.To illustrate the effects of the VDB, we consider a simple task of training a discriminator to differentiate between two Gaussian distributions.FIG1 visualizes the decision boundaries learned with different bounds I c on the mutual information.Without a VDB, the discriminator learns a sharp decision boundary, resulting in vanishing gradients for much of the space.But as I c decreases and the bound tightens, the decision boundary is smoothed, providing more informative gradients that can be leveraged by the generator.Taking this analysis further, we can extend Theorem 3.2 from to analyze the VDB, and show that the gradient of the generator will be non-degenerate for a small enough constraint I c , under some additional simplifying assumptions.The result in states that the gradient consists of vectors that point toward samples on the data manifold, multiplied by coefficients that depend on the noise.However, these coefficients may be arbitrarily small if the generated samples are far from real samples, and the noise is not large enough.This can still cause the generator gradient to vanish.In the case of the VDB, the constraint ensures that these coefficients are always bounded below.Due to space constraints, this result is presented in Appendix A.We present the variational discriminator bottleneck, a general regularization technique for adversarial learning.Our experiments show that the VDB is broadly applicable to a variety of domains, and yields significant improvements over previous techniques on a number of challenging tasks.While our experiments have produced promising results for video imitation, the results have been primarily with videos of synthetic scenes.We believe that extending the technique to imitating realworld videos is an exciting direction.Another exciting direction for future work is a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the method, to derive convergence and stability results or conditions.","answer":"Regularizing adversarial learning with an information bottleneck, applied to imitation learning, inverse reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.","answer":"Putamen"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Since wide deviations are observed in susceptibility and characteristics of the symptoms observed in manganism, these differences may be due to underlying genetic variability. Genes linked to early onset of Parkinsonism which includes ATP13A2 and parkin have already been suggested to promote development of Mn toxicity. Of the other Parkinson-linked genes, mutations in LRRK2, an autosomal dominant gene, represent another likely candidate involved in the development of manganism. In this paper the effect of shRNA LRRK2 knock-down on Mn toxicity was examined in control and DAT transfected HEK293 cells. Results demonstrate that LRRK2 down-regulation potentiates Mn toxicity in both control and DAT-transfected cell as well as potentiates DA toxicity. Combined treatment of Mn and DA further augments cell toxicity, ROS production and JNK phosphorylation in LRRK2 deficient cells compared to controls. Consistent with studies demonstrating that LRRK2 plays a role in the phosphorylation of p38, our results similarly demonstrate a decrease in p38 activation in LRRK2 knock-down cells. Our findings suggest that null mutations in LRRK2 which cause Parkinsonism potentiate Mn toxicity and increase susceptibility to develop manganism.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"manganese\\", \\"Mn\\", \\"manganism\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"p38\\", \\"parkin\\", \\"DAT\\", \\"LRRK2\\", \\"JNK\\", \\"ATP13A2\\"]}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

To better understand this phenomenon, we use the Fisher Information of the weights to measure the effective connectivity between layers of a network during training.  Counterintuitively, information rises rapidly in the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing redistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we refer to as a loss of \\"Information Plasticity\\".  Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative to the input data distribution.Once such strong connections are created, they do not appear to change during additional training.These findings suggest that the initial learning transient, under-scrutinized compared to asymptotic behavior, plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training process.Our findings, combined with recent theoretical results in the literature, also suggest that forgetting (decrease of information in the weights) is critical to achieving invariance and disentanglement in representation learning.Finally, critical periods are not restricted to biological systems, but can emerge naturally in learning systems, whether biological or artificial, due to fundamental constrains arising from learning dynamics and information processing.Critical periods are time windows of early post-natal development during which sensory deficits can lead to permanent skill impairment BID12 .Researchers have documented critical periods affecting a range of species and systems, from visual acuity in kittens BID35 BID33 to song learning in birds BID18 .Uncorrected eye defects (e.g., strabismus, cataracts) during the critical period for visual development lead to amblyopia in one in fifty adults.The cause of critical periods is ascribed to the biochemical modulation of windows of neuronal plasticity BID10 .In this paper, however, we show that deep neural networks (DNNs), while completely devoid of such regulations, respond to sensory deficits in ways similar to those observed in humans and animal models.This surprising result suggests that critical periods may arise from information processing, rather than biochemical, phenomena.We propose using the information in the weights, measured by an efficient approximation of the Fisher Information, to study critical period phenomena in DNNs.We show that, counterintuitively, the information in the weights does not increase monotonically during training.Instead, a rapid growth in information (\\"memorization phase\\") is followed by a reduction of information (\\"reorganization\\" or \\"forgetting\\" phase), even as classification performance keeps increasing.This behavior is consistent across different tasks and network architectures.Critical periods are centered in the memorization phase.Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019 Performance is permanently impaired if the deficit is not corrected early enough, regardless of how much additional training is performed.As in animal models, critical periods coincide with the early learning phase during which test accuracy would rapidly increase in the absence of deficits (dashed).(B) For comparison, we report acuity for kittens monocularly deprived since birth and tested at the time of eye-opening (solid), and normal development visual acuity in kittens as a function of age (dashed) BID7 BID23 .artificialneural networks (ANNs) are only loosely inspired by biological systems (Hassabis et al., 2017) .Most studiesto date have focused either on the behavior of networks at convergence (Representation Learning) or on the asymptotic properties of the numerical scheme used to get there (Optimization). The role ofthe initial transient, especially its effect in biasing the network towards \\"good\\" regions of the complex and high-dimensional optimization problem, is rarely addressed. To study thisinitial learning phase of ANNs, we replicate experiments performed in animal models and find that the responses to early deficits are remarkably similar, despite the large underlying differences between the two systems. In particular, we show that the quality of the solution depends only minimally on the final, relatively well-understood, phase of the training process or on its very first epochs; instead, it depends critically on the period prior to initial convergence.In animals, sensory deficits introduced during critical periods induce changes in the architecture of the corresponding areas BID4 BID34 BID9 . To determinewhether a similar phenomenon exists in ANNs, we compute the Fisher Information of the weights of the network as a proxy to measure its \\"effective connectivity\\", that is, the density of connections that are effectively used by the network in order to solve the task. Like othersbefore us BID28 , we observe two distinct phases during the training, first a \\"learning phase\\" in which the Fisher Information of the weights increases as the network learns from the data, followed by a \\"consolidation\\" or \\"compression\\" phase in which the Fisher Information decreases and stabilizes. Sensitivityto critical-period-inducing deficits is maximal exactly when the Fisher Information peaks.A layer-wise analysis of the network's effective connectivity shows that, in the tasks and deficits we consider, the hierarchy of low-level and high-level features in the training data is a key aspect behind the observed phenomena. In particular, our experiments suggest that the existence of critical periods in deep neural networks depends on the inability of the network to change its effective connectivity pattern in order to process different information (in response to deficit removal). We call thisphenomenon, which is not mediated by any external factors, a loss of the \\"Information Plasticity\\" of the network.Critical periods have thus far been considered an exclusively biological phenomenon.At the same time, the analysis of DNNs has focused on asymptotic properties and neglected the initial transient behavior.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that artificial neural networks exhibit critical period phenomena, and to highlight the critical role of the transient in determining the asymptotic performance of the network.Inspired by the role of synaptic connectivity in modulating critical periods, we introduce the use of Fisher Information to study this initial phase.We show that the initial sensitivity to deficits closely follows changes in the FIM, both global, as the network first rapidly increases and then decreases the amount of stored information, and layer-wise, as the network \\"reorganizes\\" its effective connectivity in order to optimally process information.Our work naturally relates to the extensive literature on critical periods in biology.Despite artificial networks being an extremely reductionist approximation of neuronal networks, they exhibit behaviors that are qualitatively similar to the critical periods observed in human and animal models.Our information analysis shows that the initial rapid memorization phase is followed by a loss of Information Plasticity which, counterintuitively, further improves the performance.On the other hand, when combined with the analysis of BID0 this suggests that a \\"forgetting\\" phase may be desirable, or even necessary, in order to learn robust, nuisance-invariant representations.The existence of two distinct phases of training has been observed and discussed by BID28 , although their analysis builds on the (Shannon) information of the activations, rather than the (Fisher) information in the weights.On a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), BID28 empirically link the two phases to a sudden increase in the gradients' covariance.It may be tempting to compare these results with our Fisher Information analysis.However, it must be noted that the FIM is computed using the gradients with respect to the model prediction, not to the ground truth label, leading to important qualitative differences.In Figure 6 , we show that the covariance and norm of the gradients exhibit no clear trends during training with and without deficits, and, therefore, unlike the FIM, do not correlate with the sensitivity to critical periods.However, Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019 a connection between our FIM analysis and the information in the activations can be established based on the work of BID0 , which shows that the FIM of the weights can be used to bound the information in the activations.In fact, we may intuitively expect that pruning of connections naturally leads to loss of information in the corresponding activations.Thus, our analysis corroborates and expands on some of the claims of BID28 , while using an independent framework.Aside from being more closely related to the deficit sensitivity during critical periods, Fisher's Information also has a number of technical advantages: Its diagonal is simple to estimate, even on modern state-of-the-art architectures and compelling datasets, and it is less sensitive to the choice estimator of mutual information, avoiding some of the common criticisms to the use of information quantities in the analysis of deep learning models.Finally, the FIM allows us to probe fine changes in the effective connectivity across the layers of the network FIG5 ), which are not visible in BID28 .Acomplete analysis of the activations should account not only for the amount of information (both task-and nuisance-related), but also for its accessibility, e.g., how easily task-related information can be extracted by a linear classifier. Followinga similar idea, BID24 aim to study the layer-wise, or \\"spatial\\" (but not temporal) evolution of the simplicity of the representation by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of a radial basis function (RBF) kernel embedding of each layer representation. They showthat, on a multi-layer perceptron, task-relevant information increasingly concentrate on the first principal components of the representation's embedding, implying that they become more easily \\"accessible\\" layer after layer, while nuisance information (when it is codified at all) is encoded in the remaining components. In our workwe instead focus on the temporal evolution of the weights. However, it's important to notice that a network with simpler weights (as measured by the FIM) also requires a simpler smooth representation (as measured, e.g., by the RBF embedding) in order to operate properly, since it needs to be resistant to perturbations of the weights. Thus our analysisis wholly compatible with the intuitions of BID24 . It would also beinteresting to study the joint spatio-temporal evolution of the network using both frameworks at once.One advantage of focusing on the information of the weights rather than on the activations, or behavior of the network, is to have a readout of the \\"effective connectivity\\" during critical periods, which can be compared to similar readouts in animals. In fact, \\"behavioral\\" readouts upon deficit removal, both in artificial and neuronal networks, can potentially be confounded by deficit-coping changes at different levels of the visual pathways BID4 BID16 . On the other hand,deficits in deprived animals are mirrored by abnormalities in the circuitry of the visual pathways, which we characterize in DNNs using the FIM to study its \\"effective connectivity\\", i.e., the connections that are actually employed by the network to solve the task. Sensitivity to criticalperiods and the trace of the Fisher Information peak at the same epochs, in accord with the evidence that skill development and critical periods in neuronal networks are modulated by changes (generally experience-dependent) in synaptic plasticity BID16 BID10 . Our layer-wise analysisof the Fisher Information FIG5 ) also shows that visual deficits reinforce higher layers to the detriment of intermediate layers, leaving low-level layers virtually untouched. If the deficit is removedafter the critical period ends, the network is not able to reverse these effects. Although the two systemsare radically different, a similar response can be found in the visual pathways of animal models: Lower levels (e.g., retina, lateral geniculate nucleus) and higher-level visual areas (e.g., V2 and post-V2) show little remodeling upon deprivation, while most changes happen in different layers of V1 BID34 BID9 ).An insightful interpretationof critical periods in animal models was proposed by BID16 : The initial connections of neuronal networks are unstable and easily modified (highly plastic), but as more \\"samples\\" are observed, they change and reach a more stable configuration which is difficult to modify. Learning can, however, stillhappen within the newly created connectivity pattern. This is largely compatible withour findings: Sensitivity to critical-period-inducing deficits peaks when connections are remodeled (Figure 4, Left) , and different connectivity profiles are observed in networks trained with and without a deficit ( FIG5 ). Moreover, high-level deficits suchas imageflipping and label permutation, which do not require restructuring of the network's connections in order to be corrected, do not exhibit a critical period.Our goal in this paper is not so much to investigate the human (or animal) brain through artificial networks, as to understand fundamental information processing phenomena, both in their biological or artificial implementations.It is also not our goal to suggest that, since they both exhibit critical periods, DNNs are necessarily a valid model of neurobiological information processing, although recent work has emphasized this aspect.We engage in an \\"Artificial Neuroscience\\" exercise in part to address a technological need to develop \\"explainable\\" artificial intelligence systems whose behavior can be understood and predicted.While traditionally well-understood mathematical models were used by neuroscientists to study biological phenomena, information processing in modern artificial networks is often just as poorly understood as in biology, so we chose to exploit well-known biological phenomena as probes to study information processing in artificial networks.Conversely, it would also be interesting to explore ways to test whether biological networks prune connections as a consequences of a loss of Information Plasticity, rather than as a cause.The mechanisms underlying network reconfiguration during learning and development might be an evolutionary outcome obtained under the pressure of fundamental information processing phenomena.DISPLAYFORM0 In order to avoid interferences between the annealing scheme and the architecture, in these experiments we fix the learning rate to 0.001.The Fully Connected network used for the MNIST experiments has hidden layers of size [2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, 500] .All hidden layers use batch normalization followed by ReLU activations.We fix the learning rate to 0.005.Weight decay is not used.We use data augmentation with random translations up to 4 pixels and random horizontal flipping.For MNIST, we pad the images with zeros to bring them to size 32 × 32.","answer":"Sensory deficits in early training phases can lead to irreversible performance loss in both artificial and neuronal networks, suggesting information phenomena as the common cause, and point to the importance of the initial transient and forgetting."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Rabbit cartilage cells were on β-TCP bioceramic scaffold with different micro-structures in vitro, the proliferation growth trend of chondrocytes within the scaffold was calculated, and a optimal micro-structure suitable for cartilage cell growth was determined.

The Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) is an integral membrane protein which transforms fibroblasts and is essential for EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization. LMP-1 has been shown to trigger cellular NF-kappa B activity which, however, can not fully explain the oncogenic potential of LMP-1. Here we show that LMP-1 induces the activity of the AP-1 transcription factor, a dimer of Jun / Jun or Jun / Fos proteins. LMP-1 effects on AP-1 are mediated through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway. Consequently, LMP-1 triggers the activity of the c-Jun N-terminal transactivation domain which is known to be activated upon JNK-mediated phosphorylation. Deletion analysis indicates that the 55 C-terminal amino acids of the LMP-1 molecule, but not its TRAF interaction domain, are essential for AP-1 activation. JNK-mediated transcriptional activation of AP-1 is the direct output of LMP-1-triggered signaling, as shown by an inducible LMP-1 mutant. Using a tetracycline-regulated LMP-1 allele, we demonstrate that JNK is also an effector of non-cytotoxic LMP-1 signaling in B cells, the physiological target cells of EBV. In summary, our data reveal a novel effector of LMP-1, the SEK / JNK / c-Jun / AP-1 pathway, which contributes to our understanding of the immortalizing and transforming potential of LMP-1.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"fibroblasts\\", \\"B cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"tetracycline - regulated LMP - 1 allele\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"extracellular signal - regulated kinase\\", \\"C - terminal amino acids\\", \\"Erk\\", \\"AP - 1 transcription factor\\", \\"latent membrane protein - 1\\", \\"LMP\\", \\"Jun / Jun or Jun / Fos proteins\\", \\"Jun / Fos\\", \\"JNK\\", \\"TRAF interaction domain\\", \\"AP - 1\\", \\"Jun / Jun\\", \\"LMP - 1 mutant\\", \\"c - Jun\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\", \\"c - Jun N - terminal transactivation domain\\", \\"integral membrane protein\\", \\"LMP - 1\\", \\"LMP - 1 molecule\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Through television and radio, blogs, social media and other outlets, historians in particular have situated the ongoing outbreak in relation to previous epidemics and historicised cultural and political responses. This paper furthers these historical considerations of the current pandemic by examining the way the National Health Service (NHS) and discourses of risk have figured in public and policy responses. It suggests that appeals to protect the NHS are based on longer-term anxieties about the service's capacity to care and endure in the face of growing demand, as well as building on the attachment that has developed as a result of this persistence in the face of existential threats. Similarly, the position of elderly, vulnerable and \\"at risk\\" patients relates to complex histories in which their place in social and medical hierarchies have been ambiguous. It thus argues that the ways in which time appears as both a threat and a possibility of management in the current crisis form part of a longer trajectory of political and cultural thinking.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, according to the current model, inositol imported from the environment is utilized primarily in bulk phosphatidylinositol (red and yellow phospholipid) production via a phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) localized to the Golgi complex. Inositol synthesized de novo is primarily used to generate phosphatidylinositol that is used for production of glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs). The de novo-synthesized inositol is believed to be utilized mostly for GPI production because the IMPase that dephosphorylates inositol 3-phosphate to inositol is localized to the ER, where GPI synthesis occurs. Mutants lacking TbINO1 are inviable because of diminished GPI production.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"Golgi complex\\", \\"ER\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

in fact different authors consider the first as a clinical variant of the second .haghighi et al . in 2005   suggested that pr might be classified as a cutaneous t - cell lymphoma with uncertain clinical behavior , considering it as a distinct clinicopathologic entity , separate from mf .in fact there are several clinical , histologic and immunophenotypic differences between these two entities .a more difficult distinction is that of pr by mycosis palmaris et plantaris , a rare variant of mf , characterized by acral plaques resembling those of wkd .therefore there are several features that make pr unique among the classification of cutaneous t - cell lymphomas : the acral distribution of lesions , the pronounced hyperkeratosis and acanthosis at histology , the prominent epidermotropism and the expression of e7 integrin on t - lymphocytes that binds cadherins on keratinocytes .some authors have proposed that epidermotropism of lymphoid cells is probably due to the expression of integrin e7 on the cell surface , which interacts with e - cadherin on epithelial cells .in fact expression of e7 on lymphocytes is often increased in those inflammatory conditions in which t - cells infiltrate epithelial tissues .the function of e7 is not yet fully understood , but it is likely to be important in the retention of t - cells in mucosal tissues and may also have a role in cell signaling and heterotypic communication between lymphocytes and epithelial cells . inpr three prevalent phenotypes of neoplastic cells were described : cd4 + ( t - helper phenotype ) , cd8 + ( t - cytotoxic / suppressor phenotypes ) or cd4/cd8 double negative phenotype .neoplastic cells can express other cd45 isoforms ( cd45ra ) in the disseminated aggressive variant ( kgd ) but the complete cd45 family is lost from the cell surface in the benign localized variant ( wkd ) .considering the fact that the presence of cd45 is crucial for activation of the lymphocyte - specific tyrosine kinase ( p561ck ) , which drives lymphocyte growth and transformation , lack of this molecule may be the molecular basis for the non - aggressive nature of this clonal t - cell proliferation . in our casehistological and phenotypical analysis suggested a diagnosis of kgd and , in particular , the presence of rare cd30 + cells and a component of langerhans cell type within the epidermis with a cd1a+ phenotype ( 30% ) has also been reported .. only a few cases of kgd are described in the literature ;

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Data poisoning an attack on machine learning models wherein the attacker adds examples to the training set to manipulate the behavior of the model at test time. This paper explores poisoning attacks on neural nets. The proposed attacks use ::: clean-labels''; they don't require the attacker to have any control over the labeling of training data. They are also targeted; they control the behavior of the classifier on a specific test instance without degrading overall classifier performance. For example, an attacker could add a seemingly innocuous image (that is properly labeled) to a training set for a face recognition engine, and control the identity of a chosen person at test time. Because the attacker does not need to control the labeling function, poisons could be entered into the training set simply by putting them online and waiting for them to be scraped by a data collection bot. ::: We present an optimization-based method for crafting poisons, and show that just one single poison image can control classifier behavior when transfer learning is used. For full end-to-end training, we present a ::: watermarking'' strategy that makes poisoning reliable using multiple (approx. 50) poisoned training instances. We demonstrate our method by generating poisoned frog images from the CIFAR dataset and using them to manipulate image classifiers.Literature Review:","answer":"Learning algorithms elicit representative features from a large amount of information for learning and training. However, if attackers submit crafted data with special features, the classifier may learn fooled features. For example, marking figures with number \\"6\\" as a turn left sign and putting them into the dataset, then images with a bomb may be identified as a turn-left sign, even if it is in fact a STOP sign. Xiao et al. BIB001 directly investigated the robustness of popular feature selection algorithms under poisoning attack. They reduced LASSO to almost random choices of feature sets by inserting less than 5% poisoned training samples. Shafahi et al. BIB002 found a specific test instance to control the behavior of classifier with backdoor, without any access to data collection or labeling process. They proposed a watermarking strategy and trained a classifier with multiple poisoned instances. Low-opacity watermark of the target instance is added to poisoned instances to allow overlap of some indivisible features."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Glucocorticoid (GC) excess causes a rapid loss of bone with a reduction in bone formation. Intermittent PTH (1-34) administration stimulates bone formation and counteracts the inhibition of bone formation by GC excess. We have previously demonstrated that mechanical strain enhances interleukin (IL)-11 gene transcription by a rapid induction of ΔFosB expression and protein kinase C (PKC)-δ-mediated phosphorylation of phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)-1. Because IL-11 suppresses the expression of dickkopf-1 and -2 and stimulates Wnt signaling, IL-11 appears to mediate at least a part of the effect of mechanical strain on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of PTH(1-34) and GCs on IL-11 expression in murine primary osteoblasts (mPOBs). PTH(1-34) treatment of mPOBs enhanced IL-11 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PTH(1-34) also stimulated ΔFosB expression and Smad1 phosphorylation, which cooperatively stimulated IL-11 gene transcription. PTH(1-34)-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was mediated via PKCδ and was abrogated in mPOBs from PKCδ knockout mice. Dexamethasone suppressed IL-11 gene transcription enhanced by PTH(1-34) without affecting ΔFosB expression or Smad1 phosphorylation, and dexamethasone-GC receptor complex was bound to JunD, which forms heterodimers with ΔFosB. High doses of PTH(1-34) counteracted the effect of dexamethasone on apoptosis of mPOBs, which was blunted by neutralizing anti-IL-11 antibody or IL-11 small interfering RNA. These results demonstrate that PTH(1-34) and GCs interact to regulate IL-11 expression in parallel with osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis and suggest that PTH(1-34) and dexamethasone may regulate osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis via their effect on IL-11 expression.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"dexamethasone\\", \\"Dexamethasone\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

Male children were more likely to be victims of psychological and physical violence while female children experienced more sexual violence ( p less than 0.01).Further analysis of data revealed some relationship between violence against children and nuclear family(p was less than 0.01),uncongenial and /or disturbed family environment ( p was less than 0.01 ) and dominating , short-tempered and /or aggressive parent personality ( p was less than 0.01),irrespective of the nature of the violence . Physical violence was found to be more prevalent in high income families ( p was less than 0.01 ) while children from the lower income group of families experienced more psychological violence ( p was less than 0.01 ) . Sexual violence was found to be equally prevalent in all socio-economic groups . The study also clearly indicated that academic performance of violence-experienced children , irrespective of nature of violence and socio-economic groups was poor compared to academic performance of non-violence-experienced children ( p was less than 0.01 ) . Conclusions : About one-fifth of the children under study did experience violence in Tripura . Findings speak in favor of an intervention program for creating awareness among parents and teachers about the issue of violence against children , targeted at parents when they meet for periodic parent-teachers meetings in the educational institutionsTitle 2:The German Dunkelfeld project: a pilot study to prevent child sexual abuse and the use of child abusive images.Abstract 2:INTRODUCTION Sexual interest toward prepubescents and pubescents ( pedophilia and hebephilia ) constitutes a major risk factor for child sexual abuse ( CSA ) and viewing of child abusive images , i.e. , child pornography offenses ( CPO ) . Most child sexual exploitation involving CSA and CPO are undetected and unprosecuted in the \\" Dunkelfeld \\" ( German : \\" dark field \\" ) . AIM This study assesses a treatment program to enhance behavioral control and reduce associated dynamic risk factors ( DRF ) in self-motivated pedophiles/hebephiles in the Dunkelfeld . METHODS Between 2005 and 2011 , 319 undetected help-seeking pedophiles and hebephiles expressed interest in taking part in an anonymous and confidential 1-year-treatment program using broad cognitive behavioral methodology in the Prevention Project Dunkelfeld .  Therapy was assessed using nonr and omized waiting list control design ( n=53 treated group [ TG ] ; n=22 untreated control group [ CG ] ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported pre-/posttreatment DRF changes were assessed and compared with CG . Offending behavior characteristics were also assessed via self-reporting . RESULTS No pre-/post assessment changes occurred in the control group . Emotional deficits and offense-supportive cognitions decreased in the TG ; posttherapy sexual self-regulation increased . Treatment-related changes were distributed unequally across offender groups . None of the offending behavior reported for the TG was identified as such by the legal authorities . However , five of 25 CSA offenders and 29 of 32 CPO offenders reported ongoing behaviors under therapy . CONCLUSIONS Therapy for pedophiles/hebephiles in the Dunkelfeld can alter child sexual offending DRF and reduce-related behaviors . Unidentified , unlawful child sexual exploitative behaviors are more prevalent in this population than in officially reported recidivism . Further research into factors predictive of problematic sexual behaviors in the Dunkelfeld is warrantedTitle 3:Non-traditional lifestyles and prevalence of mental disorders in adolescents in Goa, India.Abstract 3:BACKGROUND Adolescents comprise a fifth of the population of India , but there is little research on their mental health . We conducted an epidemiological study in the state of Goa to describe the current prevalence of mental disorders and its correlates among adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years . AIMS To estimate the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders in adolescents . METHOD Population -based survey of all eligible adolescents from six urban wards and four rural communities which were r and omly selected . We used a Konkani translation of the Development and Well-Being Assessment to diagnose current DSM-IV emotional and behavioural disorders . All adolescents were also interviewed on socio-economic factors , education , neighbourhood , parental relations , peer and sexual relationships , violence and substance use . RESULTS Out of 2,684 eligible adolescents , 2,048 completed the study . The current prevalence of any DSM-IV diagnosis was 1.81 % ; 95 % CI 1.27 - 2.48 . The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorders ( 1.0 % ) , depressive disorder ( 0.5 % ) , behavioural disorder ( 0.4 % ) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( 0.2 % ) . Adolescents from urban areas and girls who faced gender discrimination had higher prevalence . The final multivariate model found an independent association of mental disorders with an outgoing ' non-traditional ' lifestyle ( frequent partying , going to the cinema , shopping for fun and having a boyfriend or girlfriend ) , difficulties with studies , lack of safety in the neighbourhood , a history of physical or verbal abuse and tobacco use . Having one 's family as the primary source of social support was associated with lower prevalence of mental disorders . CONCLUSIONS The current prevalence of mental disorders in adolescents in our study was very low compared with studies in other countries . Strong family support was a critical factor associated with low prevalence of mental disorders , while factors indicative of adoption of a non-traditional lifestyle were associated with an increased prevalenceTitle 4:Childhood Experiences of Physical, Emotional and Sexual Abuse among College Students in South India.Abstract 4:OBJECTIVES To document the prevalence of physical , emotional and sexual abuse during childhood among college students . METHODS The study was conducted among college students of Puducherry , South India . Stratified r and om sampling was done to select colleges . Data were gathered using the adapted ' Ministry of Women and Child Development Question naire on Child Abuse for Young adults ' . RESULTS A total of 936 college students completed the question naire . Mean ± SD age of the participants was 19.2 ± 1.1 years . Half ( 48 % ) of the participants reported being mocked because of their physical appearance . In all , 56 % ( 524/936 ) of the participants reported that they were beaten during their childhood , of which 13.4 % ( 70/524 ) required medical treatment . Around 10 % reported someone exposing his/her private parts to them , while in 6.4 % of the cases , the perpetrator forced the study participants to expose their private parts . CONCLUSIONS Emotional , physical and sexual abuse is common in childhood and dem and s prompt interventions at the familial , community and political levelsTitle 5:Aggression in Sexually Abused Trafficked Girls and Efficacy of InterventionAbstract 5:The broad objective of this study was to underst and the incidence and severity of aggression among sexually abused girls who were trafficked and who were then further used for commercial sexual exploitation ( referred to subsequently as sexually abused trafficked girls ) . In addition , the impact of counseling for minimizing aggression in these girls was investigated . A group of 120 sexually abused trafficked Indian girls and a group of 120 nonsexually abused Indian girls , aged 13 to 18 , participated in the study . The sexually abused trafficked girls were purposively selected from four shelters located in and around Kolkata , India . The nonsexually abused girls were selected r and omly from four schools situated near the shelters , and these girls were matched by age with the sexually abused trafficked girls . Data were collected using a Background Information Schedule and a st and ardized psychological test , that is , The Aggression Scale . Results revealed that 16.7 % of the girls were first sexually abused between 6 and 9 years of age , 37.5 % between 10 and 13 years of age , and 45.8 % between 14 and 17 years of age . Findings further revealed that 4.2 % of the sexually abused trafficked girls demonstrated saturated aggression , and 26.7 % were highly aggressive , that is , extremely frustrated and rebellious . Across age groups , the sexually abused trafficked girls suffered from more aggression ( p < .05 ) , compared with the nonvictimized girls . Psychological interventions , such as individual and group counseling , were found to have a positive impact on the sexually abused trafficked girls . These findings should motivate counselors to deal with sexually abused children . It is also hoped that authorities in welfare homes will underst and the importance of counseling for sexually abused trafficked children , and will appoint more counselors for this purposeTitle 6:The acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of a population-based intervention to promote youth health: an exploratory study in Goa, India.Abstract 6:PURPOSE To evaluate the acceptability , feasibility , and effectiveness of a population -based intervention to promote health of youth ( age : 16 - 24 years ) in Goa . METHODS Two pairs of urban and rural communities were selected ; one of each was r and omly assigned to receive a multi-component intervention and the other wait-listed . The intervention comprised educational institution-based peer education and teacher training ( in the urban community ) , community peer education , and health information material s. Effectiveness was assessed through before-after population surveys at baseline and at 18 months . Outcomes were measured using a structured interview schedule with all eligible youth . Logistic regression compared each pair , adjusted for baseline differences , on prevalence of outcomes in the domains of reproductive and sexual health ( RSH ) , violence , mental health , substance use , and help seeking for health concerns . RESULTS In both intervention communities , prevalence of violence perpetrated and probable depression was significantly lower and knowledge and attitudes about RSH significantly higher ( p < .05 ) . The rural sample also reported fewer menstrual complaints and higher levels of help-seeking for RSH complaints by women , and knowledge and attitudes about emotional health and substance use ; and , the urban sample reported significantly lower levels of substance use , suicidal behavior , sexual abuse , and RSH complaints . Although information material s were acceptable and feasible in both communities , community peer education was feasible only in the rural community . The institution-based interventions were generally acceptable and feasible . CONCLUSIONS Multicomponent interventions comprising information material s , educational-institution interventions and , in rural context s , community peer interventions are acceptable and feasible and likely to be effective for youth health promotionTitle 7:Assessment of study quality for systematic reviews: a comparison of the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool: methodological research.Abstract 7:BACKGROUND The Cochrane Collaboration is strongly encouraging the use of a newly developed tool , the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool ( CCRBT ) , for all review groups . However , the psychometric properties of this tool to date have yet to be described . Thus , the objective of this study was to add information about psychometric properties of the CCRBT including inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity , in comparison with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool ( EPHPP ) . METHODS Both tools were used to assess the method ological quality of 20 r and omized controlled trials included in our systematic review of the effectiveness of knowledge translation interventions  to improve the management of cancer pain . Each study assessment was completed independently by two review ers using each tool . We analysed the inter-rater reliability of each tool 's individual domains , as well as final grade assigned to each study . RESULTS The EPHPP had fair inter-rater agreement for individual domains and excellent agreement for the final grade . In contrast , the CCRBT had slight inter-rater agreement for individual domains and fair inter-rater agreement for final grade . Of interest , no agreement between the two tools was evident in their final grade assigned to each study . Although both tools were developed to assess ' quality of the evidence ' , they appear to measure different constructs . CONCLUSIONS Both tools performed quite differently when evaluating the risk of bias or method ological quality of studies in knowledge translation interventions for cancer pain . The newly introduced CCRBT assigned these studies a higher risk of bias . Its psychometric properties need to be more thoroughly vali date d , in a range of research fields , to underst and fully how to interpret results from its application","answer":"The review indicates that prevalence rates of CSA is high among both boys and girls in India .Commercial sex workers , men who have sex with men , and women with psychiatric disorders were at higher risks for sexual abuse during childhood .In addition , the synthesis of qualitative data across studies included in the review suggests that exposure and perpetration of CSA is a multifaceted phenomenon grounded in the interplay between individual , family , community , and societal factors .The review indicates poor physical , behavioural , social , and mental health outcomes of CSA in India ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

extension gaps in the coronal plane1,2,3 ) .proper bone resection and soft tissue balance are required to create adequate joint spaces determined , in general , by the size of flexion and extension gaps in 90 knee flexion4,5 ) .it has been traditionally perceived that the extension gap of the knee should be assessed with both the hip and knee in neutral position .in contrast , there is room for controversy regarding the optimal hip flexion position for accurate measurement of the flexion gap of the knee .this is because tension of the adjacent soft tissues , including the iliotibial band and the quadriceps muscle , deemed affected by the hip flexion position and the weight of the thigh may have an influence on the knee joint space .the purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of different hip - knee flexion positions ( 45-90 vs. 90-90 ) on the flexion gap of the knee in tka using a navigation system for measurements .our hypothesis was that the flexion gap would be significantly reduced when the hip is in 45 of flexion due to the thigh weight .of the patients who underwent primary tka for osteoarthritis of the knee at our institution between may 2010 and april 2011 , those who had navigation - assisted tka and gave consent for participation were included in the study .the exclusion criteria were the presence of a disorder other than osteoarthritis , a history of prior surgery , < 90 of preoperative range of motion , 20 of varus - valgus deformity , and anteroposterial or mediolateral instability in the operated knee . in the total study population , there were 25 knees ( 11 left and 14 right knees ) in 20 patients ( 4 males and 16 females ) .their mean age at the time of surgery was 66.9 years ( range , 53 to 76 years ) and the mean body mass index was 26.07 kg / m ( range , 21.33 to 28.48 kg / m ) .tka was performed using a posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) substituting pfc sigma knee system ( depuy orthopedics , warsaw , in , usa ) under the navigational guidance of ci knee essential system ( depuy orthopedics ) in all patients .all the operations were performed by the same surgeon using a medial parapatellar approach with the hip and knee joints placed in 45 flexion position and a tourniquet applied .after joint exposure , infrared camera trackers were anchored to the distal femur and the anteromedial aspect of the proximal tibia , and the center of the hip located through rotational exercises was registered .subsequently , locations of the anatomical structures in the femur and tibia were registered using a probe in the ci knee system . under the guidance of the ci knee system using the gap technique ,tibial resection was performed with the goal of creating 0 of varus - valgus angulation in the coronal plane and 4 of posterior slope in the sagittal plane .femoral resection was performed to make the anatomical axis be in 6 valgus relative to the mechanical axis . with a trial prosthesis positioned in place ,the mechanical axis of the lower limb , extension and flexion gap balance , and medial - lateral soft - tissue balance were assessed using navigation system .when proper bone resection and soft - tissue balance were considered achieved , the thickness of the polyethylene insert was determined according to the size of the extension gap and the flexion gap measured with the hip in 45 flexion .lateral retinacular release was not considered necessary in any of the cases . after tourniquet release , with the patella reduced , medial and lateral flexion - extension gaps and midflexion gaps ( 45 of knee flexion position ) were measured with the hip in 90 flexion and 45 flexion each using navigation system ( fig .the distances from the proximal tibial cut surface to a site inferior to the femoral component ( extension gap ) and to the posterior border of the femoral component ( flexion gap ) were measured using a navigation probe without additional application of traction .values measured in 0.5 mm increments were recorded for analysis when three orthopedic surgeons agreed on the flexion angles of the hip and knee joints and knee joint gaps presented on the navigation screen .factors that may be associated with the flexion gap , including joint line elevation , femoral component rotation , and mechanical axis deviation ( mad ) were assessed : the joint line height from tibial tuberosity ( jlht ) , patellar tilt angle ( pta ) , and mad were measured on the preoperative , postoperative , and 6-month postoperative radiographs .the preoperative jlht was defined as the distance from the upper margin of the tibial tuberosity to the tibial plateau on the preoperative lateral radiograph and the postoperative jlht to the lower margin of the femoral component on the postoperative radiograph6 ) .the pta was defined as the angle created by a line connecting the medial and lateral borders of the patella and a line connecting the most anteriorly protruding portions of the medial and lateral condyles of the femur on the merchant view7 ) .the mad was measured as the angle between the mechanical axis connecting the centers of the femoral head and the ankle and the anatomical axis of the tibia on the weight - bearing long - leg anteroposterior radiograph8 ) , and a varus angle was assigned a negative value whereas a valgus angle was designated a positive value .the differences in joint gaps according to hip flexion positions and the preoperative and postoperative radiographic findings were evaluated using paired t - test with significance set at p<0.05 .regarding the joint gap measurements using navigation system , the mean extension gap was 12.901.70 mm on the medial side and 13.281.70 mm on the lateral side .the mean midflexion gap measured with the knee in 45 flexion was 12.981.78 mm on the medial side and 13.281.86 mm on the lateral side .the mean flexion gap measured with the hip in the 45 flexion position was 13.022.17 mm on the medial side and 13.122.24 mm on the lateral side , whereas the value was 12.922.03 mm and 13.082.29 mm , respectively , when the hip was in the 90 flexion position .therefore , no statistically significant differences between the medial and lateral joint gaps were observed regardless of the flexion position . the mean difference in the flexion gap between the 45 and 90 hip flexion positions ranged from 0 - 1.5 mm :the mean difference was 0.340.35 mm on the medial side and 0.400.43 mm on the lateral side .the medial and lateral flexion gaps for the 45 hip flexion position were greater than those for the 90 hip flexion position , but the differences were not statistically significant .in addition , no notable differences were observed in the comparison of the medial and lateral extension gaps , midflexion gaps , and flexion gaps in 45 and 90 hip flexion positions ( table 1 ) .regarding the radiographic assessment , the mean mad was -4.8 ( range , -8.7 to -0.1 ) preoperatively and -0.4 ( range , -2.4 to + 2.9 ) postoperatively .the mean pta was 4.1 ( range , 1.0 to 6.7 ) preoperatively and 2.8 ( range , 0.4 to 6.3 ) postoperatively .the changes in the in the pta and jltb between the preoperative and postoperative period did not show statistical significance ( table 2 ) .in this study , the mean medial and lateral flexion gaps in the 45-90 hip - knee flexion position ( 13.022.17 mm and 13.122.21 mm , respectively ) were greater than those in the 90-90 flexion position ( 12.922.03 mm and 13.082.29 mm , respectively ) , but the differences were statistically insignificant .in addition , a polyethylene insert change due to notable difference in the flexion gaps between the two hip flexion positions ( 2.5 mm ) was not required in any of the patients .therefore , it is our understanding that the hip flexion position has no major influence on the flexion gap measurement in tka , and the impact of the thigh weight on the flexion gap can be offset by soft tissue tension . in tka ,bone resection and soft tissue balancing for lower limb alignment are primary prognostic factors1,2,3 ) .specifically , the extent of resection of the posterior femoral condyle and the proximal tibia and soft tissue laxity determine the flexion gap size between the tibia and the femur . a flexion - extension gap mismatch could result in pain , swelling , and joint instability in the early postoperative period9,10 ) and eventually lead to tka failure in the long - term due to component loosening caused by polyethylene wear11,12 ) .an appropriate joint gap in the knee can be achieved by proper bone resection and soft tissue balancing based , in general , on the assessment of the extension gap and flexion gap measured in 90 knee flexion and either the 45 or 90 hip flexion4,5 ) . due to the possible impact of the hip flexion positions on the tension of the surrounding soft tissues , such as the quadriceps muscle and the iliotibial band , and the thigh weight, a controversy can be raised regarding the optimal hip flexion position for precise measurement of the flexion gap in the knee .however , our study results showed that the two hip flexion positions did not result in significant differences in the flexion gap , indicating that neither the thigh weight nor the soft tissue tension has substantial influence on the joint gap at least in pcl substituting tka .knee joint gaps may be associated with the extent of bone resection and soft tissue release , degree of posterior tibial slope , preservation of pcl , and rotation of implants .however , we think that these factors played a minor role in our study focusing solely on the influence of the hip flexion , considering that there was no remarkable radiographic change in the posterior tibial slope and joint line height during the preoperative and postoperative period . in addition, the flexion gap measurement was performed following bone resection and soft tissue balancing ; thus , we believe the impact of such factors could be ruled out as much as possible .knee joint gaps are often estimated with subjective measurement methods . in an attempt to improve objectivity ,tensors require manual application of joint distraction force14,15 ) , and the measurement values can vary depending on the magnitude of the applied force .in addition , tensors may not allow for patellar reduction during joint gap measurement , which may affect the joint gap size16,17 ) .in contrast , navigation systems facilitate relatively accurate measurements with the patella reduced without application of distraction force . in our study ,flexion gaps could be assessed with the patella reduced due to the employment of a navigation system , and the measurement errors could be minimized by using the values derived from the program for analysis . however , considering that high soft tissue tension can be caused by pre - existing flexion contracture or severe varus deformity , the composition of the study population with only relatively mild deformity may have biased the study outcomes . thus , we think our results should be confirmed in further studies that involve larger populations .there was no statistically significant difference in the flexion gap between 45 and 90 hip flexion positions in tka .the thigh weight and soft tissue tension did not appear to influence selection of the thickness of the polyethylene insert .therefore , we believe that the hip flexion position ( 45 or 90 ) duding flexion gap measurement can be determined based on the surgeon 's preference .","answer":"purposeto evaluate the influence of thigh weight in different hip flexion positions on the knee flexion gap in total knee arthroplasty ( tka).materials and methodswe evaluated 20 patients ( 25 knees ) with osteoarthritis of the knee that underwent tka using a navigation system from may 2010 to april 2011 .  after posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing , complete soft tissue balancing , and fixation of all components with cement , the flexion gaps were measured with the patello -

We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels. Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size. Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time. Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) stand at the forefront of many recent developments in deep learning. Yet a major difficulty with these models is their tendency to overfit, with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers. Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning.","answer":"Exploring alternatives to traditional RNNs for sequence tasks is a major area of current research. Quasi-recurrent neural networks are related to several such recently described models, especially the strongly-typed recurrent neural networks (T-RNN) introduced by [1] . While the motivation and constraints described in that work are different, [1] 's concepts of learnware'' and firmware'' parallel our discussion of convolution-like and pooling-like subcomponents. As the use of a fully connected layer for recurrent connections violates the constraint of strong typing'', all strongly-typed RNN architectures (including the T-RNN, T-GRU, and T-LSTM) are also quasi-recurrent. However, some QRNN models (including those with attention or skip-connections) are not strongly typed''. In particular, a T-RNN differs from a QRNN as described in this paper with filter size 1 and -pooling only in the absence of an activation function on @math . Similarly, T-GRUs and T-LSTMs differ from QRNNs with filter size 2 and - or -pooling respectively in that they lack @math on @math and use @math rather than sigmoid on @math ."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

In this paper, we present a new approach for full page text recognition. Localization of the text lines is based on regressions with Fully Convolutional Neural Networks and Multidimensional Long Short-Term Memory as contextual layers. In order to increase the efficiency of this localization method, only the position of the left side of the text lines are predicted. The text recognizer is then in charge of predicting the end of the text to recognize. This method has shown good results for full page text recognition on the highly heterogeneous Maurdor dataset.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: In the context of historical collection conservation and worldwide diffusion, this paper presents an automatic approach of historical book page layout segmentation. In this article, we propose to search the homogeneous regions from the content of historical digitized books with little a priori knowledge by extracting and analyzing texture features. The novelty of this work lies in the unsupervised clustering of the extracted texture descriptors to find homogeneous regions, i.e. graphic and textual regions, by performing the clustering approach on an entire book instead of processing each page individually. We propose firstly to characterize the content of an entire book by extracting the texture information of each page, as our goal is to compare and index the content of digitized books. The extraction of texture features, computed without any hypothesis on the document structure, is based on two non-parametric tools: the autocorrelation function and multiresolution analysis. Secondly, we perform an unsupervised clustering approach on the extracted features in order to classify automatically the homogeneous regions of book pages. The clustering results are assessed by internal and external accuracy measures. The overall results are quite satisfying. Such analysis would help to construct a computer-aided categorization tool of pages.[2]: In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning method for page segmentation of historical handwritten documents available as color images. We consider page segmentation as a pixel labeling problem, i.e., each pixel is classified as either periphery, background, text block, or decoration. Traditional methods in this area rely on carefully hand-crafted features or large amounts of prior knowledge. In contrast, we apply convolutional autoencoders to learn features directly from pixel intensity values. Then, using these features to train an SVM, we achieve high quality segmentation without any assumption of specific topologies and shapes. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.","answer":"Techniques like the ones proposed by [1] or [2] classify pixels into text or non-text but need post-processing techniques to constitute text lines."},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Clonidine, an antihypertensive drug, binds to alpha 2-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors. The endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptors may be a clonidine-displacing substance, a small molecule isolated from bovine brain. This clonidine-displacing substance was purified and determined by mass spectroscopy to be agmatine (decarboxylated arginine), heretofore not detected in brain.

This offers the current best known allocation scheme. However, for @math , the gap reduces to @math soda08 .A similar constant gap bound has been established for parallel allocations with @math communication rounds lenzen . In this paper we propose a novel multi-choice allocation algorithm, ( @math ) achieving a constant gap with a high probability for the sequential single-dimensional online allocation problem with constant @math . We achieve a maximum load of @math with high probability for constant @math choice scheme with constant number of retries or rounds per ball. We also show that the bound holds even for an arbitrary large number of balls, @math . Further, we generalize this result to (i) the weighted case, where balls have weights drawn from an arbitrary weight distribution with finite variance, (ii) multi-dimensional setting, where balls have @math dimensions with @math randomly and uniformly chosen filled dimension for @math , and (iii) the parallel case, where @math balls arrive and are placed parallely in the bins. We show that the gap in these case is also a constant w.h.p. (independent of @math ) for constant value of @math with expected constant number of retries per ball.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: It is well known that after placing n balls independently and uniformly at Ž . random into n bins, the fullest bin holds Q log nrlog log n balls with high probability.

CCC 1042-9832r98r020159-30[2]: We explore the fundamental limits of distributed balls-into-bins algorithms. We present an adaptive symmetric algorithm that achieves a bin load of two in log* n+O(1) communication rounds using O(n) messages in total. Larger bin loads can be traded in for smaller time complexities. We prove a matching lower bound of (1-o(1))log* n on the time complexity of symmetric algorithms that guarantee small bin loads at an asymptotically optimal message complexity of O(n). For each assumption of the lower bound, we provide an algorithm violating it, in turn achieving a constant maximum bin load in constant time. As an application, we consider the following problem. Given a fully connected graph of n nodes, where each node needs to send and receive up to n messages, and in each round each node may send one message over each link, deliver all messages as quickly as possible to their destinations. We give a simple and robust algorithm of time complexity O(log* n) for this task and provide a generalization to the case where all nodes initially hold arbitrary sets of messages. A less practical algorithm terminates within asymptotically optimal O(1) rounds. All these bounds hold with high probability.","answer":"In the parallel setting, [2] showed that a constant bound on the gap is possible with @math communication rounds. Adler et.al.

Enzymes encoded by the glutathione S-tranferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and pi 1 (GSTP1) genes, which are expressed in breast tissue, catalyze the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous electrophiles. Reduced enzyme activity, due to carriage of the GSTM1 deletion or the GSTP1 Ile105Val Val allele, may therefore affect susceptibility to breast cancer and related conditions. In a case-control study of Chinese women, we examined whether these polymorphisms were associated with risk of breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions. Women diagnosed with breast cancer (n=615) or fibrocystic breast conditions (n=467) were compared to women without clinical breast disease (n=878). We also examined whether these associations differed by menopausal status or by presence of proliferation in the extra-tumoral epithelium among women with breast cancer and in lesions among women with fibrocystic conditions. No overall association of either GST polymorphism with risk of breast cancer or fibrocystic breast conditions was observed. There was some evidence of slightly elevated cancer risk associated with carriage of the GSTM1 null genotype and at least one GSTP1 105-Val allele (OR=1.33, 95% CI, 0.99-1.80), compared to carriage of the GSTM1 non-null and GSTP1 Ile/Ile genotypes. This relationship was stronger in women who had breast cancer with extra-tumoral tissue proliferation (OR=1.77, 95% CI, 1.03-3.04). Our results suggest that GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes do not individually influence susceptibility to breast cancer or fibrocystic breast conditions. The observed increased risk of breast cancer associated with joint carriage of the GSTM1 null genotype and GSTP1 105-Val allele needs confirmation in other studies.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Subsequent epidemiology and research has identified the cell receptor as exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26) ; that MERS-CoV has a broad tropism, replicating better in some cells lines and eliciting a more proinflammatory response than SARS-CoV; is widespread in DCs; has the potential to infect other animals and that MERS kills its human host more often than SARS did (20-40 % versus 9 % for SARS [14] ) [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In humans, overt disease was given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome, with the acronym MERS. From intermittent animal-to-human spill-over events, the MERS-CoV spreads sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older adults, especially males, with pre-existing diseases. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, with around 20 % of all cases to date involving healthcare workers (HCWs). Although DCs appear to suffer the equivalent of a 'common cold' from MERS-CoV infection, in humans, the virus can be a more serious and opportunistic pathogen associated with the death of up to 40 % of reported cases. It has yet to be established whether infections thought to have been acquired from an animal source produce a more severe outcome than those spread between humans [20] . Studies have established that the mean incubation period for MERS is five to six days, ranging from two to 16 days, with 13 to 14 days between when illness begins in one person and subsequently spreads to another [21] [22] [23] [24] . Among those with progressive illness, the median time to death is 11 to 13 days, ranging from five to 27 days [23, 24] . Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline, only to be followed by a more severe systemic and respiratory syndrome [25, 26] . The first WHO case definition [27] defined probable cases of MERS based on the presence of febrile illness, cough and requirement for hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract (LRT) involvement. It also included roles for contact with a probable or confirmed case or for travel or residence within the Arabian Peninsula. If strictly adhered to, only the severe syndrome would be subject to laboratory testing, which was the paradigm early on [21] . From July 2013, the revised WHO case definition included the importance of seeking out and understanding the role of asymptomatic cases and from June 2014, the WHO definition more clearly stated that a confirmed case included any person whose sample was RT-PCR positive for MERS-CoV, or who produced a seroconversion, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. [28] [29] [30] Apart from the WHO and the KSA Ministry of Health reports, asymptomatic or subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection were documented in the scientific literature although not always as often as occurred early on [31, 32] . The KSA definition of a case became more strict on 13 th May 2014, relying on the presence of both clinical features and laboratory confirmation [33] . Testing of asymptomatic people was recommended against from December 2014 [34] , reinforced by a case definition released by the KSA Ministry of Health in June 2015 [35] . The KSA has been the source of 79 % of human cases. Severe MERS is notable for its impact among older men with comorbid diseases including diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis and various lung, renal and cardiac conditions [36] [37] [38] . Interestingly in June 2015, an outbreak in South Korea followed a similar distribution [39, 40] . Among laboratory confirmed cases, fever, cough and upper respiratory tract (URT) signs and symptoms usually occur first, followed within a week by progressive LRT distress and lymphopaenia [37] . Patients often present to a hospital with pneumonia, or worse, and secondary bacterial infections have been reported [37, 41] . Disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure [37] . MERS has reportedly killed approximately 35 % of all reported cases, 42 % of cases in the KSA, yet only 19 % of cases in South Korea, where mortality ranged from 7 % among younger age groups to 40 % among those aged 60 years and above [42] ; all may be inflated values with asymptomatic or mild infections sometimes not sought or not reported [34] . General supportive care is key to managing severe cases [43] . Children under the age of 14 years are rarely reported to be positive for MERS-CoV, comprising only 1.1 % (n = 16) of total reported cases. Between 1 st September 2012 and 2 nd December 2013, a study described the then tally of paediatric cases in the KSA, which stood at 11 (two to 16 years of age; median 13 years); nine were asymptomatic (72 %) and one infant died [44] . In Amman, Jordan, 1,005 samples from hospitalized children under the age of two years with fever and/or respiratory signs and symptoms were tested but none were positive for MERS-CoV RNA, despite being collected at a similar time to the first known outbreak of MERS-CoV in the neighbouring town of Al-Zarqa [45] . A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother did subsequently develop antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection [46] . Her exposure history to a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive relative and an antibody-reactive husband, her incubation period and her symptom history met the WHO criteria for being a probable MERS-CoV case [46] . Diagnostic methods were published within days of the ProMED email announcing the first MERS case [47] , including several now gold standard in-house RT-rtPCR assays (Fig. 2 ) as well as virus culture in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells [18, 47, 48] . A colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) epithelial cell line has since been recommended for isolation of infections MERS-CoV [49] . We previously [18] . ).

Beneath this is a schematic depicting the location of RT-PCR primers (blue arrows indicate direction) and oligoprobes (green rectangles) used in the earliest RT-rtPCR screening assays and conventional, semi-nested (three primers) RT-PCR confirmatory sequencing assays [47, 48] .

[47, 48] Those assays recommended by the WHO are highlighted underneath by yellow dots [53] . The NSeq reverse primer has consistently contained one sequence mismatch with some MERS-CoV variants. An altered version of that from Mackay IM, Arden KE. Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd. Virus Res 2015 Vol 202:60-88 with permission from Elsevier [5] reviewed the broad tropism of MERS-CoV [5] . However, as is well described, cell culture is a slow, specialised and insensitive method [50] while PCR-based techniques are the preferred method for MERS-CoV detection. The first open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b; Fig. 2 ) have become a key diagnostic and taxonomic target for CoV species identification. With less than 80 % identity between the amino acid sequence of MERS ORF 1ab and betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, it can be concluded that it is a novel and distinct virus. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode ten open reading frames with 5' and 3' untranslated regions [51] . The structural proteins include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [52] . The products of ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode nonstructural proteins. The majority of specimen testing to date has employed validated RT-rtPCR assays shown to be sensitive and specific [47, 48, 53] . The RealStar® kit uses these WHOrecommended assays [54] . The target sequences of these screening assays have not changed among genomes examined until at least mid-2015 (IMM observation). Other RT-rtPCR assays have been developed and validated for use as laboratory-based diagnostic tools [55] [56] [57] . Additionally, loop-mediated [58, 59] or recombinase polymerase [60] isothermal assays have been designed for field deployment. The detection of MERS-CoV antigen has not been common to date but the combination of short turnaround time from test to result, high throughput and identification of viral proteins makes this an attractive option. Detection of viral proteins rather than viral RNA indicates the likely presence of infectious virus. The first rapid immunochromatographic tool described could detect recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein from DC nasal swabs with 94 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity compared to RT-rtPCR [61] . A different approach used a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein with a sensitivity of 10 3 TCID 50 and 100 % specificity [62] . Demonstration of a seroconversion to a MERS-CoV infection meets the current WHO definition of a case so optimized and thoroughly validated sero-assays employed alongside good clinical histories are useful to both identify prior MERS-CoV infection and help support transmission studies. Because serology testing is, by its nature, retrospective, it is usual to detect a viral footprint, in the form of antibodies, in the absence of any signs or symptoms of disease and often in the absence of any viral RNA [63] . Strategic, widespread sero-surveys of humans using samples collected after 2012 are infrequent. Much of the Arabian Peninsula and all of the Horn of Africa lack baseline data describing the proportion of the community who may have been infected by a MERS-CoV. However, sero-surveys have had widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a transmission source for MERS-CoV. Because of the identity shared between DC and human MERS-CoV (see Molecular epidemiology: using genomes to understand outbreaks), serological assays for DC sero-surveys should be transferrable to human screening with minimal re-configuration. Also, no diagnostically relevant variation in neutralization activity have been found from among a range of circulating tested MERS-CoV isolates and sera, so whole virus or specific protein-based sero-assays should perform equivalently in detecting serological responses to the single MERS-CoV serotype [49] . The development of robust serological assays requires reliable panels of wellcharacterized animal or human sera, including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to likely sources of cross-reaction [64] . Obtaining these materials was problematic and slowed the development and commercialization of antibody detection assays for human testing [64] . A number of commercial ELISA kits, immunofluorescent assays (IFA) kits, recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies have been released [31, [65] [66] [67] [68] . Initially, conventional IFAs were used for human sero-surveys. These relied on MERS-CoV-infected cell culture as an antigen source, detecting the presence of human anti-MERS-CoV IgG, IgM or neutralizing antibodies in human samples [18, 48, 69] . No sign of MERS-CoV antibodies was found among 2,400 sera from patients visiting Hospital in Jeddah, from 2010 through 2012, prior to the description of MERS-CoV [18] . Nor did IFA methods detect any sign of prior MERS-CoV infection among a small sample of 130 healthy blood donors from another Hospital in Jeddah (collected between Jan and Dec 2012) [70] . Of 226 slaughterhouse workers, only eight (3.5 %) were positive by IFA, and those sera could not be confirmed by virus neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of crossreactive antigen in the whole virus IFA [70] . Whole virus MERS-CoV IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera and this could not be resolved by an NT test which was also cross-reactive [71] . IFA using recombinant proteins instead of whole-virus IFA, has been shown to be a more specific tool [31] . Since asymptomatic zoonoses have been posited [72] , an absence of antibodies to MERS-CoV among some humans who have regular and close contact with camels may reflect the rarity of actively infected animals at butcheries, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs [70] , a pre-existing cross-protective immune status or some other factor(s) resulting in a low risk of disease and concurrent seroconversion developing after exposure in this group. IFA using recombinant proteins instead. Some sero-assays have bypassed the risks of working with infectious virus by creating transfected cells expressing recombinant portions of the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid and spike proteins [48, 73] , or using a recombinant lentivirus expressing MERS-CoV spike protein and luciferase [74, 75] . A pseudo particle neutralization (ppNT) assay has seen widespread used in animal studies and was at least as sensitive as the traditional microneutralization (MNT) test. [10, 74, [76] [77] [78] ] Studies using small sample numbers and ppNT found no evidence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody in sera from 158 children with LRT infections between May 2010 and May 2011, 110 sera from 19 to 52 year old male blood donors and 300 selfidentified animal workers from the Jazan Region of the KSA during 2012 [79, 80] .Question: What has epidemiology and research identified the MERS-CoV's cell receptor is?","answer":"as exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26)"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

BHMT is expressed at high levels in rat liver and its expression is regulated by dietary Met and choline. BHMT is also found in rat kidney, albeit in substantially lower amounts, but it is not known whether kidney BHMT expression is regulated by dietary Met or choline. Similarly, CHDH activity is highest in the liver and kidney, but the regulation of its expression by diet has not been thoroughly investigated. Sprague Dawley rats ( approximately 50 g) were fed, for 9 d in 2 x 3 factorial design (n = 8), an l-amino acid-defined diet varying in l-Met (0.125, 0.3, or 0.8%) and choline (0 or 25 mmol/kg diet). Liver and kidney BHMT and CHDH were assessed using enzymatic, Western blot, and real-time PCR analyses. Liver samples were also fixed for histological analysis. Liver BHMT activity was 1.3-fold higher in rats fed the Met deficient diet containing choline, which was reflected in corresponding increases in mRNA content and immunodetectable protein. Independent of dietary choline, supplemental Met increased hepatic BHMT activity approximately 30%. Kidney BHMT and liver CHDH expression were refractory to these diets. Some degree of fatty liver developed in all rats fed a choline-devoid diet, indicating that supplemental Met cannot completely compensate for the lack of dietary choline in growing rats.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Choline\\", \\"Met\\", \\"choline\\", \\"methionine\\", \\"l-amino acid\\", \\"l-Met\\", \\"homocysteine\\", \\"betaine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Choline dehydrogenase\\", \\"CHDH\\", \\"choline dehydrogenase\\", \\"betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase\\", \\"BHMT\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

The @math -approximate Braun-Blanquet similarity search problem is to preprocess a collection of sets @math such that, given a query set @math , if there exists @math with @math , then we can efficiently return @math with @math . We present a simple data structure that solves this problem with space usage @math and query time @math where @math and @math . Making use of existing lower bounds for locality-sensitive hashing by O' (TOCT 2014) we show that this value of @math is tight across the parameter space, i.e., for every choice of constants @math . In the case where all sets have the same size our solution strictly improves upon the value of @math that can be obtained through the use of state-of-the-art data-independent techniques in the Indyk-Motwani locality-sensitive hashing framework (STOC 1998) such as Broder's MinHash (CCS 1997) for Jaccard similarity and 's cross-polytope LSH (NIPS 2015) for cosine similarity. Surprisingly, even though our solution is data-independent, for a large part of the parameter space we outperform the currently best data-dependent method by Andoni and Razenshteyn (STOC 2015).Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We have developed an efficient way to determine the syntactic similarity of files and have applied it to every document on the World Wide Web. Using this mechanism, we built a clustering of all the documents that are syntactically similar. Possible applications include a \\"Lost and Found\\" service, filtering the results of Web searches, updating widely distributed web-pages, and identifying violations of intellectual property rights.[2]: We consider bottom-k sampling for a set X, picking a sample Sk(X) consisting of the k elements that are smallest according to a given hash function h. With this sample we can estimate the relative size f=|Y| |X| of any subset Y as |Sk(X) intersect Y| k. A standard application is the estimation of the Jaccard similarity f=|A intersect B| |A union B| between sets A and B. Given the bottom-k samples from A and B, we construct the bottom-k sample of their union as Sk(A union B)=Sk(Sk(A) union Sk(B)), and then the similarity is estimated as |Sk(A union B) intersect Sk(A) intersect Sk(B)| k. We show here that even if the hash function is only 2-independent, the expected relative error is O(1√(fk)). For fk=Omega(1) this is within a constant factor of the expected relative error with truly random hashing. For comparison, consider the classic approach of kxmin-wise where we use k hash independent functions h1,...,hk, storing the smallest element with each hash function. For kxmin-wise there is an at least constant bias with constant independence, and it is not reduced with larger k. Recently showed that bottom-k circumvents the bias if the hash function is 8-independent and k is sufficiently large. We get down to 2-independence for any k. Our result is based on a simply union bound, transferring generic concentration bounds for the hashing scheme to the bottom-k sample, e.g., getting stronger probability error bounds with higher independence. For weighted sets, we consider priority sampling which adapts efficiently to the concrete input weights, e.g., benefiting strongly from heavy-tailed input. This time, the analysis is much more involved, but again we show that generic concentration bounds can be applied.[3]: [4]: Min-wise hashing is an important method for estimating the size of the intersection of sets, based on a succinct summary (a \\"min-hash\\") of each set. One application is estimation of the number of data points that satisfy the conjunction of m >= 2 simple predicates, where a min-hash is available for the set of points satisfying each predicate. This has application in query optimization and for approximate computation of COUNT aggregates. In this paper we address the question: How many bits is it necessary to allocate to each summary in order to get an estimate with (1 + - epsilon)-relative error? The state-of-the-art technique for minimizing the encoding size, for any desired estimation error, is b-bit min-wise hashing due to Li and Konig (Communications of the ACM, 2011). We give new lower and upper bounds: Using information complexity arguments, we show that b-bit min-wise hashing is em space optimal for m=2 predicates in the sense that the estimator's variance is within a constant factor of the smallest possible among all summaries with the given space usage. But for conjunctions of m>2 predicates we show that the performance of b-bit min-wise hashing (and more generally any method based on \\"k-permutation\\" min-hash) deteriorates as m grows. We describe a new summary that nearly matches our lower bound for m >= 2. It asymptotically outperform all k-permutation schemes (by around a factor Omega(m log m)), as well as methods based on subsampling (by a factor Omega(log n_max), where n_max is the maximum set size).[5]: Given two documents A and B we define two mathematical notions: their resemblance r(A, B) and their containment c(A, B) that seem to capture well the informal notions of \\"roughly the same\\" and \\"roughly contained.\\" The basic idea is to reduce these issues to set intersection problems that can be easily evaluated by a process of random sampling that can be done independently for each document. Furthermore, the resemblance can be evaluated using a fixed size sample for each document. This paper discusses the mathematical properties of these measures and the efficient implementation of the sampling process using Rabin (1981) fingerprints.[6]: Computing the transitive closure in directed graphs is a fundamental graph problem. We consider the more restricted problem of computing the number of nodes reachable from every node and the size of the transitive closure. The fastest known transitive closure algorithms run inO(min mn,n2.38 ) time, wherenis the number of nodes andmthe number of edges in the graph. We present anO(m) time randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm that estimates, with small relative error, the sizes of all reachability sets and the transitive closure. Another ramification of our estimation scheme is a O(m) time algorithm for estimating sizes of neighborhoods in directed graphs with nonnegative edge lengths. Our size-estimation algorithms are much faster than performing the respective explicit computations.[7]:","answer":"Similarity Estimation.

IL-2 -, IL-12 -, and IFN-alpha-mediated signaling pathways were analyzed in primary NK cells and in the NK3. 3 cell line. Gel mobility shift and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that in addition to activating STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) and STAT5, IL-2 induced tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 alpha, which formed IFN-gamma-activated sequence-binding complexes by itself and with STAT3. Although IL-2 and IFN-alpha activated STAT1 alpha and STAT5, IL-2 predominantly activated STAT5, while IFN-alpha predominantly activated STAT1 alpha. IL-2 induced less STAT1 alpha activation and IFN-alpha induced greater STAT5 activation in NK3. 3 cells compared with preactivated primary NK cells. In NK3. 3 cells, IL-2 induced comparable formation of c-fos promoter sis-inducible element IFN-gamma-activated sequence-binding complexes containing STAT3 alone with complexes containing STAT3 and STAT1 alpha, while in preactivated primary NK cells, it preferentially induced complexes containing STAT3 and STAT1 alpha. Thus, signaling in NK3. 3 cells is not always identical with that in primary NK cells. In contrast to IL-2 and IFN-alpha, IL-12 induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 and variable weak phosphorylation of STAT3. However, supershift analyses using the c-fos promoter sis-inducible element probe showed that IL-12 activated STAT4, STAT1 alpha, and STAT3, and induced complexes containing STAT4 only, STAT4 with STAT1 alpha, STAT3 with STAT1 alpha, or STAT1 alpha only in preactivated primary NK cells. STAT1 alpha activation by IL-12 correlated with increased phosphorylation of serine, but not tyrosine. Finally, IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, while IL-12 induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 in both preactivated primary NK and NK3. 3 cells. Differential phosphorylation and consequent differential activation of both separate and overlapping STAT proteins by IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-alpha may provide a molecular basis for the similarities and differences in the actions of these cytokines on NK cells.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"preactivated primary NK and NK3 . 3 cells\\", \\"NK3 . 3 cell line\\", \\"preactivated primary NK\\", \\"NK3 . 3 cells\\", \\"preactivated primary NK cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human natural killer cells\\", \\"primary NK cells\\", \\"NK cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"c - fos promoter\\", \\"c - fos promoter sis - inducible element\\", \\"c - fos promoter sis - inducible element probe\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"IL - 12\\", \\"IL - 12 -\\", \\"STAT1 alpha\\", \\"TYK2\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"these cytokines\\", \\"STAT proteins\\", \\"IFN - alpha\\", \\"c - fos promoter sis - inducible element IFN - gamma - activated sequence - binding complexes\\", \\"Janus kinase\\", \\"IFN - alpha -\\", \\"IFN - gamma - activated sequence - binding complexes\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"STAT5\\", \\"STAT3\\", \\"JAK1\\", \\"STAT4\\", \\"JAK2\\", \\"signal transducer and activator of transcription - 3\\", \\"JAK3\\", \\"IFN - gamma -\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

The functional interaction of visual cortical neurons and hippocampal place cells during spatial navigation behavior has yet to be elucidated. Here we show that, like hippocampal place cells, many neurons in the primary visual cortex( V1) of freely moving rats selectively fire at specific locations as animals run repeatedly on a track. The V1 location-specific activity leads hippocampal place cell activity both spatially and temporally. The precise activities of individual V1 neurons fluctuate every time the animal travels through the track, in a correlated fashion with those of hippocampal place cells firing at overlapping locations. The results suggest the existence of visual cortical neurons that are functionally coupled with hippocampal place cells for spatial processing during natural behavior. These visual neurons may also participate in the formation and storage of hippocampal-dependent memories.Introduction:Spatial information is presumably encoded by hippocampal ‘place cells’, which fire predominantly when an animal is at one or a few specific places( place fields) of a given space( O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; McNaughton et al., 1983; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993). How these cells establish the location specificity has been a subject under intensive investigation. It is known that path integration of the information generated from self-motion is important for hippocampal place cell activity( Hafting et al., 2005; McNaughton et al., 2006). However, external sensory cues are equally important, if not more. In particular, visual cues play a pivotal role in place cell activities( Muller, 1996; Knierim, 2002; Colgin et al., 2008; Ravassard et al., 2013). For example, changing the proximal or distal visual cues alters firing rates and/or firing locations of place cells in a one- or two-dimensional space( Lee et al., 2004a, 2004b; Leutgeb et al., 2005), and the rotation of a salient cue card on the wall of a symmetric open arena evokes an equivalent rotation of place field locations( Muller and Kubie, 1987). How visual cue information contributes to place cell activities is unknown. Visual cues are presumably encoded and processed in the visual cortex, which is connected to the hippocampus via a multi-synaptic pathway involving the associational cortices including the entorhinal cortex( Miller and Vogt, 1984; Vaudano et al., 1991; Lavenex and Amaral, 2000; Furtak et al., 2007). Computational models have shown that hippocampal cells can integrate input from cortical cells, in particular those encoding visual cues, to form a conjunctive response that is location-specific( de Araujo et al., 2001; Schonfeld and Wiskott, 2015). Alternatively, it is proposed that local visual cues influence place field location through entorhinal ‘border’ cells, whereas distal cues influence place field orientation via entorhinal ‘head direction’ cells( Knierim and Hamilton, 2011). Obviously, these models and others similar require the functional interaction between those visual cortical neurons encoding visual cues and corresponding hippocampal place cells. However, experimental data for such an interaction are very limited( Ji and Wilson, 2007), and the nature of this interaction during natural spatial behavior remains unexplored. To probe the visual cortical—hippocampal interaction during spatial processing, we simultaneously recorded cells in the primary visual cortex( V1) and in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, while freely moving rats traversed back and forth on a track. We aimed to test a hypothesis that there exists a specific population of visual cortical neurons that responds to visual features of the track with specific activity patterns and functionally interacts with those hippocampal place cells representing the same track. We found that, like CA1 place cells, a large number of V1 neurons also displayed firing activities that were specific to particular locations on the track, especially around the visual landmarks. The location-specific activities of V1 neurons, on average, led those of CA1 place cells in both the spatial and temporal domains. For those V1 and CA1 cells that displayed spatially overlapping activity, their precise firing characteristics co-fluctuated every time the animal traveled through the track. These findings suggest the existence of specific V1 activities that participate in the encoding of external spaces. Given the critical role of the hippocampus in spatial memories( Scoville and Milner, 1957; Squire, 1992; Eichenbaum et al., 1999; Burgess and O’Keefe, 2003), these visual cells may also participate in the formation and storage of the spatial memories encoded by hippocampal place cells.Discussion:We have analyzed the firing activities of V1 and CA1 cells in freely moving rats as they ran back and forth on a C-shaped track for food reward. We found that a large number of cells in all layers of V1, like CA1 place cells, fire selectively and reliably at specific locations of the track. These location-responsive V1 cells have multiple, narrow firing fields on a given trajectory of the track. The number of V1 firing fields rises and falls as animals approach and move away from visual landmarks, leading the rise and fall in the number of CA1 place fields. The precise lap-by-lap fluctuations in the firing rate and firing location of V1 cells are correlated with those of CA1 cells with overlapping firing fields. Finally, V1 cells display an experience-dependent change in their location-specificity at the time scale of days. These results reveal that V1 cells have location-specific responses to a particular environment and are functionally coupled with the hippocampal place cells encoding the same environment. Our data supports a functional interaction between V1 location-responsive cells and hippocampal place cells. Here we provide three pieces of evidence. First, the number of V1 firing fields fluctuates as the animal travels through a trajectory and this fluctuation is highly correlated with the change in the number of CA1 firing fields. More interestingly, we found that the V1 fields rise and fall earlier than the CA1 fields and this leading effect is consistent on both running directions. Second, the pair-wise cross-correlation analysis reveals a bias toward positive time lags, suggesting that, again, V1 location-specific activity appears earlier than the CA1 place field activity at the population level. Third, the lap-to-lap fluctuations in the firing rates and firing locations of individual V1 cells within their firing fields are significantly correlated with those of CA1 place cells with overlapping place fields. This is true even after removing the modulation of speed and head direction on firing rate and firing location. The correlated variation is specific to CA1-V1 cell pairs with the overlapping firing fields, suggesting a remarkably precise interaction at a fine temporal and spatial scale. These observed correlations are unlikely driven by non-specific common factors because of the following reasons. First, both the field distribution and pair-wise cross-correlation analyses show that V1 activities lead CA1 activities during trajectory running. Although the lead could be caused by CA1 and V1 cells independently responding to some unknown common factors with a delay, which we cannot rule out, the lead time of 60–120 ms, is consistent with our previous studies on the interaction between V1 and CA1 during slow-wave sleep( Ji and Wilson, 2007; Haggerty and Ji, 2014), when behavioral factors do not vary and the brain state is relatively uniform. Therefore, the delay likely reflects the propagation of activity from V1 to CA1. Second, the lap-by-lap co-fluctuation of overlapping pairs is much higher than that of non-responsive pairs. Since both types of pairs share overlapping locations, if common factors were mainly responsible, the non-responsive pairs would show correlated fluctuations comparable to those of overlapping pairs. The leading of V1 activity over CA1 activity suggests a forward interaction, through which V1 location-responsive cells send visual information to CA1 place cells. The location-specific activity in V1 cells does not necessarily mean that V1 cells directly respond to places per se as hippocampal place cells do. Given what we know about the primary function of V1 neurons in behaving rodents( Yao et al., 2007; Niell and Stryker, 2010; Xu et al., 2012), they are likely driven by the visual cues associated with specific locations on the track, supported by our observation that V1 firing fields are more distributed around the landmarks. In particular, prospective firing may occur when V1 neurons ‘see’ landmarks in front of the animal. Retrospective firing may occur as V1 neurons ‘see’ landmarks behind the animal's head, which is possible because the side-facing eyes of rats have a wide visual field and can see visual stimuli behind or above the head( Wallace et al., 2013), although other mechanisms such as feedback from the higher cortical areas or the hippocampus may also be responsible. The landmark information represented by the V1 cells can reach the hippocampus via a multi-synaptic pathway, which includes the secondary visual cortex, temporal cortex, perirhinal/postrhinal cortex, and entorhinal cortex( Miller and Vogt, 1984; Vaudano et al., 1991; Lavenex and Amaral, 2000; Furtak et al., 2007). In this way, the V1 location-responsive cells may allow local and distal visual cues to influence CA1 place cell activities( Muller and Kubie, 1987; Lee et al., 2004a, 2004b; Leutgeb et al., 2005). Our finding of location-responsive cells in the sensory area V1 raises the possibility that the distinction between what we call either a spatial or sensory response is not as clear as we thought. On one hand, given the apparent modulation of hippocampal place cells by visual cues( Muller and Kubie, 1987; Lee et al., 2004a, 2004b; Leutgeb et al., 2005), the response of a hippocampal cell to a particular place also contains a ‘sensory’ response to the visual cues associated with that place. In our data, the CA1 place fields are preferentially distributed around the landmarks, just as the V1 firing fields are, suggesting a bias of CA1 place cell activity by sensory input. On the other hand, the response of a V1 cell to visual clues at a particular place effectively establishes a ‘spatial’ response to the place, if the visual cues are stable in space. In this manner, the firing fields of V1 cells may appear to be similar to the CA1 place fields, with the important differences in that V1 cells exhibited less specificity by nature of non-zero baseline firing and multiple firing fields. The difference in V1 and CA1 location-specific activity is just that, because hippocampal place cell activities result from an integration of not just visual information, but also information from other sensory modalities and self-motion, hippocampal place fields are more specific and predictive of the animal's spatial location than the predominantly sensory-driven V1 firing fields. Therefore, it is possible that spatial representation in the brain may involve a gradual transformation along the anatomical pathway connecting the sensory cortex to the hippocampus, which converts a primarily sensory-driven, less reliable spatial response in the sensory cortex to a more precise and robust spatial response in the hippocampus. Hippocampal place cells are believed not just to form a neural representation of space, but encode spatial memory and other type of memories( Eichenbaum et al., 1999; Burgess and O'Keefe, 2003; Ferbinteanu et al., 2006; Knierim at al., 2006; Moser et al., 2008). If so, then the gradual transformation of spatial representation also suggests that a spatial memory trace is not only encoded by hippocampal place cells, but also by the cortical cells involved in the transformation, which are presumably distributed in many cortical areas. This idea is an essential component in many modern theories of memory, including index theory( Teyler and Rudy, 2007), two-stage memory processing theory( Buzsaki, 1996), and the theory of two complementary memory systems( McClelland et al., 1995). All these theories propose the involvement of relevant cortical cells in long-term memory storage. Our previous study shows that activity patterns of V1 and CA1 cells during track running are coordinately replayed later during slow-wave sleep( Ji and Wilson, 2007), suggesting the involvement of V1 cells in memory consolidation. The current study provides another piece of key evidence that V1 cells and CA1 place cells functionally interact during the stage of memory formation as animals run a novel track for a first week or so. In our data, the lap-by-lap co-fluctuation between V1-CA1 cell pairs with overlapping firing fields is qualitatively similar to that between pairs of CA1-CA1 place cells with overlapping place fields. Since CA1 place cells with overlapping place fields are believed to constitute functional ‘cell assemblies’ that encode the spatial memory of the animal's environment( Harris et al., 2003; Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006), it is possible that the overlapping V1 location-responsive cells and hippocampal place cells are part of the larger ‘cortical-hippocampal assemblies’ that encode and store the same spatial memory trace. Therefore, we propose that the V1 location-specific activities are a substrate for encoding and storing the visual component of long-term spatial memories, and possibly episodic memories.","answer":"The brain is able to create and maintain a map of our surroundings as we go about our daily activities . It is thought that some of this spatial information is first processed in a region of the brain called the visual cortex , the information is then relayed to a region called the hippocampus , where the map is reliably stored . However , researchers do not fully understand how the brain transfers spatial information between these two regions . To explore what happens to the information , Haggerty and Ji recorded electrical signals from the brains of rats that were being trained to run back and forth along a C-shaped track . As they ran on the track , the rats gradually developed spatial maps of there surroundings . Electrodes were used to record brain signals from both the visual cortex and the hippocampus as this development took place . Similar to previous studies , analysis of the recordings showed that a specific population of neurons in the hippocampus , called CA1 neurons , produced an electrical signal whenever the rat ran past specific locations on the track , such as corners . Building on this Haggerty and Ji showed a population of neurons in the visual cortex called V1 neurons also produced location-specific electrical signals at the same time . Moreover , the electrical signals of these two populations of neurons fluctuate together in a coordinated fashion . The results of Haggerty and Ji support the idea that there exists a specific population of visual cortical neurons that communicate with hippocampal neurons in the development of a particular spatial map ."},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Some persistent viruses infect DCs and can disrupt their functions in vitro. However, these viruses remain strongly immunogenic in vivo. Thus what role DC infection plays in the pathogenesis of persistent infections is unclear. Here we show that a persistent, B cell-tropic gamma-herpesvirus, Murid Herpesvirus-4( MuHV-4), infects DCs early after host entry, before it establishes a substantial infection of B cells. DC-specific virus marking by cre-lox recombination revealed that a significant fraction of the virus latent in B cells had passed through a DC, and a virus attenuated for replication in DCs was impaired in B cell colonization. In vitro MuHV-4 dramatically altered the DC cytoskeleton, suggesting that it manipulates DC migration and shape in order to spread. MuHV-4 therefore uses DCs to colonize B cells.Introduction:Dendritic cells( DCs) act as sentinels against infection: they encode pathogen-responsive receptors, abound at pathogen entry sites, and orchestrate both innate and adaptiveimmune responses[1],[2]. Virus-infected DCs are generally immunogenic[3]–[5], and DC infection may be important for optimal T cell priming[6]. However several persistent viruses, which might be expected to limit their exposure to host immunity, efficiently infect DCs[7]–[10]. The infected DCs may function abnormally in vitro[11],[12], but the corresponding in vivo infections remain potently immunogenic. Therefore how DC infection benefits these persistent viruses, or whether it instead benefits the host, is unclear. Murid Herpesvirus-4( MuHV-4) is a gamma-herpesvirus that readily allows in vivo analysis of host colonization[13],[14]. Like Epstein-Barr virus and the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus, MuHV-4 persists in B cells[15],[16]. It also acutely infects macrophages and dendritic cells[17]–[19]. Myeloid infection provides MuHV-4 with a site of persistence in B cell-deficient mice, but the antibody deficiency of these mice leads to a somewhat atypical chronic lytic infection[20]; in immunocompetent mice, infected macrophages and dendritic cells are hard to detect long-term[19]. Therefore myeloid infection seems more likely to be important for establishing MuHV-4 host colonization than for maintaining it. Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus can also infect myeloid cells in vitro[9],[21]. While they seem rarely to do so in vivo, their clinical presentations post-date infection by at least 1 month[22], so early host colonization is rarely studied. Thus acute myeloid cell infection may not be unique to MuHV-4. The difficulty of curing established gamma-herpesvirus infections makes early events in host colonization important to understand. It has been suggested that incoming Epstein-Barr virus infects B cells and so establishes latency directly[23]. This would argue against an important role for myeloid infection. However, good supporting evidence for direct B cell infection is lacking. Indeed vaccination to block Epstein-Barr virions binding to B cells failed to reduce the incidence of infection[24]. And while DNA from lung-inoculated, replication-deficient MuHV-4 has been found associated with B cells[25],[26], viral genome-positive B cells did not reach the spleen, so whether the detected DNA was a viable primary infection or merely adsorbed debris was unclear. That fibroblast-propagated MuHV-4 infects mice well[27] and B cells poorly[28] would argue against B cells being a significant primary target. Natural host entry probably occurs via the upper respiratory tract rather than the lung[29], but MuHV-4 lacking thymidine kinase or ribonucleotide reductase fails to infect by this route and neither enzyme is required for replication in B cells[30],[31]. Therefore here too B cells would seem an unlikely primary target. How then does MuHV-4 reach B cells? HIV can infect T cells via DCs[32],[33], and DCs also communicate with B cells[34], so exploiting DC/lymphocyte interactions could be a common theme among lymphotropic viruses. However, in vivo evidence is again sparse. HIV-infected DCs are hard to find in vivo, and most HIV taken up by DCs in vitro is degraded. Thus it has been possible only to hypothesize that DCs contribute to host entry[35]. MuHV-4 allows more comprehensive analysis, and this is what we undertook here. As removing DCs causes immunosuppression[36], we used DC-specific cre recombinase expression to inhibit MuHV-4 replication in DCs or to mark genetically viruses that had replicated in a DC, while leaving normal DC functions intact.Discussion:Lymphotropic viruses arrive at mucosal epithelia, whereas naive lymphocytes circulate through organized lymphoid tissue. Therefore lymphotropic viruses face a problem in reaching their target cells. Lymphatic channels normally provide a route for DCs and cell-free antigens to travel from epithelia to lymph node subcapsular sinuses. Small, soluble antigens can pass directly into B cell follicles via specialized conduits[55]–[57], but larger antigens- immune complexes[58], virus-sized particles[59], and cell-free virions[60],[61]- are first captured by subcapsular sinus macrophages. Thus viruses can enter lymph nodes via migratory DCs or subcapsular sinus macrophages. Most analysis of DC migration has depended on indirect measures such as T cell priming[62]. In contrast, virion capture by subcapsular sinus macrophages has been observed directly[60],[61]. However, direct imaging has depended on injecting large virion numbers. Such high doses may reveal mainly high-capacity rather than high-efficiency capture pathways, and the tissue pressures created by injection tend to force material into and along lymphatics. Therefore the relevance to non-invasive infections of antigen injections must still be established. Here we analyzed lymph node colonization after a non-invasive infection. MuHV-4 does not establish a detectable cell-free viraemia[63], and depends for its in vivo propagation on cell/cell spread[64] more than on cell-free virion binding[65] or release[66]. Thus it might be expected to follow a cell-associated route to lymph nodes. Consistent with this idea, we identified a major role for DCs in passing infection to B cells. Thus MuHV-4 sets a new precedent for host exploitation by a lymphotropic virus. We could not determine whether MuHV-4 reaches lymph nodes only via DCs, but the similar efficiencies of eCFP excision and 8/9-loxP virus attenuation between in vitro DC infection and in vivo host colonization argued that DC infection plays a predominant role. This would also be consistent with MuHV-4 still infecting the lymph nodes of B cell-deficient mice[67]. CD11c is a well-established DC marker, but is not exclusive to DCs[68]. Expression on activated T cells can be discounted here as MuHV-4 does not infect T cells. Lung macrophages express CD11c[68], as do subcapsular sinus macrophages at a low level[60]. However lysM-cre mice, which express cre in macrophages[69], showed substantial eCFP loss from loxP-eCFP MuHV-4 only after lower respiratory tract infection( unpublished data). Therefore while macrophages may feature prominently in MuHV-4 lung infection, DCs provided the major route of its transfer from nose to lymph nodes. Thus MuHV-4 exploits olfaction to enter the upper respiratory tract[29]; lymphocytes to persist[70]; and DCs to link them by virus transport. Cells migrate by forming cytoplasmic protrusions, adhering these to the extracellular matrix, then detaching and contracting their trailing edges[71]. Actin, focal adhesion kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation all play central roles, so the redistributions of these markers in infected DCs, independent of viral lytic gene expression, was consistent with MuHV-4 inducing latently infected DCs to migrate. ORF27/ORF58-dependent actin rearrangements[72] could then promote further virion spread upon lytic reactivation. However, in vitro DC migration was prevented by infected DCs not detaching from plastic, and we cannot exclude that the infected SCLN DCs were resident and infected through antigen capture, rather than being migratory. Therefore virus-induced DC migration needs further investigation; current evidence establishes only that DC infection is important for establishing B cell infection in lymph nodes. MuHV-4-infected DCs may also promote the amplification of B cell infection by secreting the M3 chemokine binding protein to protect in trans against CD8+ T cell attack[73]. In both this setting and that of virus transfer, the B cell latency defects of MuHV-4 lacking its MHC class I down-regulation gene K3[51] or its bcl-2 homolog M11[52] could reflect that these genes function in DCs[74],[75]. Exploiting DCs presumably brings gamma-herpesviruses advantages of efficiency and stealth. Whether it also creates possibilities for therapeutic intervention remains to be seen.","answer":"We detect invading viruses with dendritic cells and eliminate them with lymphocytes .

However, most genome analysis is typically confined to the nuclear genome. We conducted a metabolomic QTL analysis on a reciprocal RIL population structured to examine how variation in the organelle genomes affects phenotypic variation. This showed that the cytoplasmic variation had effects similar to, if not larger than, the largest individual nuclear locus. Inclusion of cytoplasmic variation into the genetic model greatly increased the explained phenotypic variation. Cytoplasmic genetic variation was a central hub in the epistatic network controlling the plant metabolome. This epistatic influence manifested such that the cytoplasmic background could alter or hide pairwise epistasis between nuclear loci. Thus, cytoplasmic genetic variation plays a central role in controlling natural variation in metabolomic networks. This suggests that cytoplasmic genomes must be included in any future analysis of natural variation.Introduction:A central goal of modern biology is to understand how the integration of gene functions across a genome lead to the individual’s specific phenotype. A key facet to this effort is to develop models that would allow directly inferring a species phenotypic variation from its genetic variation. This goal of mathematically linking genetic to phenotypic variation is central to all studies of quantitative genetics ranging from human genetics to plant breeding to ecology and has led to massive genome resequencing projects focused on developing the genomic databases to allow these studies( Liti et al., 2009; Altshuler et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2011). However, in most quantitative genomics studies, genome analysis is largely confined to the nuclear genome with much less attention paid to the organellar genome. This is in contrast to the central role that the organellar genome plays in controlling organismal metabolism and function and the developing body of literature suggesting that organellar genomic variation can modulate the effects of nuclear genomic variation. Genomic variation in human organelles has been linked to several severe diseases( Wallace et al., 1988; Taylor and Turnbull, 2005; Schon et al., 2012). However, these organellar variants are typically rare with large phenotypic consequences such that they can be followed using simple maternal inheritance studies without consideration for quantitative variation in the nuclear genome( Schon et al., 2012). More recently, quantitative studies on human diseases suggest that genetic variation in organellar genomes modify the quantitative effect of nuclear loci and disease phenotypes( Battersby and Shoubridge, 2001; McRae et al., 2008; Schon and Przedborski, 2011). Additionally, the use of structured populations in mice, yeast, and birds have shown that cytoplasmic genome variation can influence high order phenotypes including fitness, cognition, and biomass( Roubertoux et al., 2003; Zeyl et al., 2005; Park et al., 2006; Dimitrov et al., 2009). Within ecological studies, mitochondrial variation has also been shown to alter fitness and create hybrid isolation in a variety of invertebrate species( Willett and Burton, 2004; Wade and Goodnight, 2006; Dowling et al., 2007, 2010; Wolf, 2009; Willett, 2012). However, these studies didn’t directly interrogate the interaction of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes for quantitative traits or test the breadth of phenotypes affected. In plants, genetic variation in mitochondria is also linked with large qualitative phenotypes, such as cytoplasmic male sterility( Hanson, 1991; Schnable and Wise, 1998). Plant breeding has a long history of using diallele crosses to test for the presence of maternal effects( cytoplasmic genetic variation) on a phenotype and this was recently extended to a small reciprocal F2 family structure to show that the cytoplasmic effects could have significant impacts on plant height in maize( Tang et al., 2013). In rice, agronomic traits have also been shown to be influenced by interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes but the specific loci were not identified( Tao et al., 2004). However, these reciprocal F2 populations typically have generated the impression that cytoplasmic effects on phenotypic variation are quite small in plants possibly because of an inability to account for interactions between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes( Singh, 1965; Crane and Nyquist, 1967; Eenink and Garretsen, 1980; Miura et al., 1997; Primomo et al., 2002). In contrast to the previous estimates of small effects, genomic sequencing within Arabidopsis has shown the presence of considerable genetic polymorphism in both the plastidic and mitochondrial genomes suggesting the potential for broad phenotypic consequences( Moison et al., 2010). The above studies have shown that cytoplasmic genome variation can influence phenotypic variation. Additionally, genes underlying qualitative interactions between the nucleus and cytoplasm leading to cytoplasmic male sterility and interspecific isolation have been identified. There are, however, numerous open questions remaining about how cytoplasmic variation influences quantitative phenotypic variation. What is the level of phenotypic variation influenced by genetic variation in the cytoplasm in comparison to individual nuclear loci? How much epistatic interaction is there between genetic variation in nuclear loci and the cytoplasmic genomes? What is the breadth of phenotypes that might be influenced by cytoplasmic variation? To begin answering these questions, we utilized metabolomics to investigate how genetic variation in the cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes interacts to control metabolome variation in the reciprocal Arabidopsis Kas × Tsu recombinant inbred line( RIL) population( McKay et al., 2008; Juenger et al., 2010). We focused on metabolomics because it is cost effective for large sample numbers and because plant organelles, mitochondria and plastids, are central to the function of plant primary metabolism, as well as many specialized metabolites in both energy generation and biosynthesis( Fiehn et al., 2000; Roessner et al., 2001; Fiehn, 2002). Within Arabidopsis, there are nearly 13, 000 genes in the nuclear genome predicted to be involved in metabolic processes of which ∼3000 may be targeted to the mitochondria and the plastid( Arabidopsis genome initiative, 2000). This included complete biosynthetic pathways for numerous amino acids and key energy production processes like respiration and photosynthesis. Aiding these processes are 88 total predicted genes in the plastidic genome and 121 in the mitochondrial genome; most of which function to facilitate the metabolic processes that occur in organelles using both nuclear and cytoplasmic-encoded proteins. Thus, variation in the organellar genomes could directly influence the function of any of nuclear gene functioning within the organelle( Etterson et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007; Wolf, 2009). This suggests that metabolism is an ideal phenotype to use for testing how cytoplasmic variation can influence phenotypic variation. We measured the metabolome within the Kas × Tsu RIL population to test how cytoplasmic variation can affect quantitative variation within the metabolome. This population was generated from a reciprocal cross and approximately half of the resulting lines carry Kas organelles while the other half carry Tsu organelles allowing for explicit analysis of the influence of cytoplasmic genetic variation( McKay et al., 2008; Juenger et al., 2010). Analysis of the Kas × Tsu RIL population metabolome showed that genetic variation in the organelles influenced the accumulation of over 80% of the detectable metabolites. In contrast to previous observations suggesting that the cytoplasm has only small effects, phenotypic changes associated with cytoplasmic variation were as large and often larger than that found for individual nuclear loci( Singh, 1965; Crane and Nyquist, 1967; Eenink and Garretsen, 1980; Miura et al., 1997; Primomo et al., 2002). In addition, the cytoplasm was found to be a central hub in the epistatic network controlling natural variation in plant metabolism. This centrality led to the cytoplasmic background displaying the unexpected ability to hide or alter epistatic interactions between nuclear loci. Thus, genetic variation in the cytoplasmic organelles has widespread and large quantitative effects on natural phenotypic variation and can influence the link between nuclear loci.Discussion:Even though maternal contribution to complex phenotypes has long been suspected, most previous genomic surveys of natural variation using transcriptomics or metabolomics have either not had the capacity to directly assess the influence of cytoplasmic genetic variation or just ignore it completely. Thus, we used the reciprocal Kas × Tsu Arabidopsis RIL population to directly quantify the role of cytoplasmic genetic variation in quantitative variation of metabolomics traits. Our analysis showed that the cytoplasmic genome variation affected the phenotypic variation for over 80% of metabolites. The affected metabolites included key parts of central metabolism and some of the most specialized metabolites( Figures 1, 5 and 6). Interestingly, the combined variance of the nuclear genome was larger than the variance due to cytoplasmic genome( Figure 1). In contrast, cytoplasmic genetic variation affected more metabolites than any of the individual nuclear loci typically with larger effects( Figures 3–5 and Figure 4—figure supplements 1–5). This is true even though the average nuclear locus spanned approximately the same number of genes as the organellar genomes combined. We also identified a high level of significant epistatic interaction between cytoplasmic genetic variation and nuclear genetic variation, as cytonuclear epistasis( Etterson et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007; Wolf, 2009). This cytonuclear epistasis explained as much, if not more, metabolic variation than the combined additive effects of the nuclear loci. In addition, the cytoplasmic genome controlled larger phenotypic changes than the nuclear locus within a cytonuclear interaction( Figure 7). This interaction between the cytoplasmic and nuclear loci was further extended to three-way interactions and showed that the cytoplasmic background could hide or alter the interaction between two nuclear loci( Figure 9). Thus, the cytoplasmic genetic background plays a key role in determining how natural variation within nuclear loci will function. The effect of the cytoplasmic genetic variation was spread out across nearly all of primary metabolism making it impossible to ascribe a causal link with solely plastidic or mitochondrial genes( Figure 5). Similarly analysis of genomic variation in the two organelles found a large number of SNPs that could be affecting numerous genes within the organelles with an observed bias towards genes involved in the NADH dehydrogenase complex( Figure 5—source data 1). Thus, organellar genomes could be playing a role in the cytoplasmic genetic influence on metabolite variation, but given their coinheritance, it is not possible to resolve the direct causal polymorphisms. Separating the two genomes to resolve their relative roles would require identifying rare individuals where the two organelles show bi-parental inheritance instead of the uni-parental/maternal mode of inheritance typical for Arabidopsis( Azhagiri and Maliga, 2007). The plant cytoplasmic genomes contain only about 1% of the number of genes as found within the nuclear genome( Arabidopsis genome initiative, 2000). Yet genetic variation in this small fraction of genes has a large consequence upon the plants metabolic variation( Figure 5). This could be from genetic polymorphisms in organellar genes that are central to plant metabolism, such as those central to photosynthesis or NADH synthesis( Figure 5—source data 1). Alternatively, the polymorphisms could be within the organellar genes that are required to facilitate the function of the several thousand nuclear genes whose protein products are transported into the organelles and function there( Ajjawi et al., 2010). Finally, it is possible that the polymorphisms in the organelle impact retrograde signaling pathways, thus altering the function of the nuclear regulatory mechanisms( Vinti et al., 2000; Larkin et al., 2003; Estavillo et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2012). Identifying the specific causal polymorphisms within the cytoplasmic genomes will require direct whole genome sequencing of the organellar genomes from all available genotypes to query the extent of natural variation in the organellar genome( Cao et al., 2011). An alternative may be to identify the causal genes underlying the nuclear loci involved in three-way interactions with the cytoplasm to triangulate the identity of the cytoplasmic gene. In this work, we report a first genomic survey of how genetic variation within cytoplasmic genomes influences metabolomic variation. Cytoplasmic genetic variation alters metabolite variation with effects that are equivalent to, if not greater than, individual nuclear loci. More importantly, the cytoplasmic background significantly influences the ability to detect epistasis between nuclear loci. Thus cytoplasmic genomes should be included in any future analysis of natural variation, either by being included as a genotype in GWA studies or by designing future populations as reciprocal populations to allow for direct analysis of the cytoplasmic genomic variation in controlling the phenotype. This inclusion will allow direct assessment of how cytoplasmic genomic variation influences other phenotypic classes, such as transcriptomics or broader physiological phenotypes. Natural genetic variation in the organellar genomes while frequently ignored will have to be kept at the front of future experimental approaches designed to understand the evolution and genetic architecture of organismal phenotypes.","answer":"The vast majority of genes in plant and animal cells are located on chromosomes within the nucleus .

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software allows the semi-automatic analysis of the kinetic characteristics of complete enhancing lesions, providing additional information about lesion vasculature. The diagnostic value of this information has not yet been quantified.(MATERIALS AND METHODS) Consecutive patients from routine diagnostic studies (1.5 T, 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine, dynamic gradient-echo sequences at 1-minute intervals) were analyzed prospectively using CAD. Dynamic sequences were processed and reduced to a parametric map. Curve types were classified by initial signal increase (not significant, intermediate, and strong) and the delayed time course of signal intensity (continuous, plateau, and washout). Lesion enhancement was measured using CAD. The most suspect curve, the curve-type distribution percentage, and combined dynamic data were compared. Statistical analysis included logistic regression analysis and receiver-operating characteristic analysis.(RESULTS) Fifty-one patients with 46 malignant and 44 benign lesions were enrolled. On receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the most suspect curve showed diagnostic accuracy of 76.7 +/- 5%.

Less commonly implicated are opioids and psychotomimetic drugs, including cannabis.Among 326 patients (184 males), the most frequent stroke risk factors overall were dyslipidaemia (187), smoking (161), hypertension (105) and obesity (92). Fifty-one patients used illicit drugs, mostly comprising marijuana and amphetamines.Patients in Adelaide are more likely to be obese, to be misusing marijuana and amphetamines, to suffer a cardioembolic event and to have a stroke that concurrently affects both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation.RCVS was spontaneous in 37% of patients and secondary in the 63% others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants.We reported two cases of young stroke associated with drug misuse. Case 1 used amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and LSD for few yaers, and developed occlusion of a middle cerebral artery. Case 2 presented aphasia shortly after marijuana smoking.Marijuana may have accelerated stroke onset, but essential cause of stroke in this case must be protein S mutation.Cannabis is the most widely consumed among the illicit drugs worldwide, but it has only exceptionally been associated to cerebrovascular disease.We here describe 2 young patients (26 and 29 years, respectively) who suffered from ischemic stroke in temporal relation with cannabis consumption.The review of the literature on this topic reveals another 18 patients with stroke in association to cannabis use.Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke.Marijuana may trigger a myocardial infarction and have a vasospastic effect.Despite the fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug, there are only a few reports associating its use with cerebrovascular disease.We describe a patient who suffered three ischaemic strokes immediately after cannabis consumption.Cannabis use may be associated with ischaemic stroke in young patients, but its mechanism is unclear.A right occipital ischemic stroke occurred in a 37-year-old Albanese man with a previously uneventful medical history, 15 min after having smoked a cigarette with approximately 250 mg of marijuana.Therefore, as the family history for cerebrovascular events, blood pressure, clotting tests, examinations for thrombophilia, vasculitis, extracranial and intracranial arteries and cardiac investigations were normal or respectively negative, the stroke was attributed to the chronic cannabis consumption.Three adolescent males had similar presentations of headache, fluctuating level of consciousness or lethargy, visual disturbance, and variable ataxia after self-administration of marijuana.Episodic marijuana use may represent a risk factor for stroke in childhood, particularly in the posterior circulation.Although several mechanisms exist by which marijuana use might contribute to the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions or acutely trigger cardiovascular events, there are few data regarding marijuana/THC use and cardiovascular disease outcomes.Reported here is the case of a previously healthy young man who smoked marijuana on a daily basis and had an occipital lobe stroke; he was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden.This case suggests that marijuana smoking may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis in otherwise healthy individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden.Thus, chronic abuse of marijuana might be a risk factor for stroke.A 22-year-old man with a five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse presented with a left hemiparesis preceded by three transient ischaemic attacks, two of which occurred whilst smoking cannabis. Substance abuse was the only identifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease.Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF.Research directions might include more studies of cardiovascular disease outcomes and relationships of marijuana with cardiovascular risk factors, studies of metabolic and physiologic effects of chronic marijuana use that may affect cardiovascular disease risk, increased understanding of the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in cardiovascular regulation, and studies to determine if there is a therapeutic role for cannabinoids in blood pressure control or for neuroprotection after stroke.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In fact, genome-wide analyses that correlate histone marks with RNA processing signals raise the possibility that specific RNA processing factors may modulate transcription and help to \\"write\\" chromatin marks. Here we show that the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC) directs recruitment of transcription elongation factors and establishes proper histone marks during active transcription. A directed genetic screen revealed that deletion of either subunit of the CBC confers a synthetic growth defect when combined with deletion of genes encoding either Ctk2 or Bur2, a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of P-TEFb. The CBC physically associates with these complexes to recruit them during transcription and mediates phosphorylation at Ser-2 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. To understand how these interactions influence downstream events, histone H3K36me3 was examined, and we demonstrate that CBCΔ affects proper Set2-dependent H3K36me3. Consistent with this, the CBC and Set2 have similar effects on the ability to rapidly induce and sustain activated gene expression, and these effects are distinct from other histone methyltransferases. This work provides evidence for an emerging model that RNA processing factors can modulate the recruitment of transcription factors and influence histone modification during elongation.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Ser\\", \\"C\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"H3\\", \\"CBC\\", \\"yeast cap binding complex\\", \\"Bur2\\", \\"RNA polymerase II\\", \\"Ctk2\\", \\"histone\\", \\"P-TEFb\\", \\"histone H3\\", \\"Set2\\", \\"nuclear cap binding complex\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

An understanding of this network will benefit from systems such as Drosophila that have the ability to genetically manipulate neural activities. However, the fly's small size makes it challenging to analyze walking in this system. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed an optical method coupled with high-speed imaging that allows the tracking and quantification of gait parameters in freely walking flies with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using this method, we present a comprehensive description of many locomotion parameters, such as gait, tarsal positioning, and intersegmental and left-right coordination for wild type fruit flies. Surprisingly, we find that inactivation of sensory neurons in the fly's legs, to block proprioceptive feedback, led to deficient step precision, but interleg coordination and the ability to execute a tripod gait were unaffected.Introduction:Ever since life became terrestrial ∼360 million years ago, animals have developed increasingly sophisticated methods to navigate their environments( Dickinson et al., 2000). Locomotion is essential for animals to escape from predators, find mates, and search for food. One of the most common forms of terrestrial locomotion depends on the movement of multi-jointed legs. For this to occur, animal nervous systems face two main computational challenges. First, multiple leg joints must move rhythmically and in a precisely coordinated fashion to allow the stereotyped movements that occurs during the swing and stance phases of each step cycle. Second, these movements must be coordinated between legs, which number four in a typical tetrapod and six in a hexapod. Both challenges are met in part by interactions between central pattern generators( CPGs), neural networks within the central nervous system that have the capacity to generate rhythmic outputs( MacKay-Lyons, 2002). When used for walking, individual CPGs result in the rhythmic and alternating activity of motor neurons that control the flexion and extension of single leg joints( Bässler, 1977; Strauss, 2002; Borgmann et al., 2009; Büschges et al., 2011). Leg movement coordination is also assisted by proprioceptive sensory inputs that report the load and position of leg joints( Bässler, 1977; Borgmann et al., 2009). Other sensory modalities, such as visual, olfactory and gravitational, also modulate the activity of locomotor CPGs to allow animals to readily change their motor behavior in response to their environment( Frye, 2010). An understanding of locomotion requires the identification of the neurons that comprise locomotor neural circuits. Given the complexity of these circuits, insects provide an attractive model to achieve this goal due to their relative simplicity, approachable physiology and availability of genetic tools. Moreover, adult insects share with vertebrates the same general principles of locomotion( Pearson, 1993). Nevertheless, despite many anatomical similarities, it is less clear how similar the neural circuitries underlying locomotion are in vertebrates and invertebrates. Groundbreaking studies in cockroaches, locusts and stick insects have identified many components and fundamental rules that regulate the walking apparatus, such as the definition of multiple gaits( Graham et al., 1985; Burrows, 1992; Zill et al., 2004; Ritzmann and Büschges, 2007; Büschges et al., 2008). However, unlike in vertebrates, where gait transitions are discontinuous, it is less clear in which situations insects use distinct gaits and how they transition between them. Although theoretical considerations suggested the possibility that gait transitions may be more gradual than they are in vertebrates, this question has not been fully resolved( Graham et al., 1985). Walking speeds in cockroaches, for example, cluster into two groups, but both rely on the tripod gait( Bender et al., 2011). The stick insect tends to use a tetrapod gait at slower speeds and a tripod gait at faster speeds( Graham et al., 1985). Drosophila, on the other hand, are reported to primarily use the tripod gait( Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990). Similar questions arise with respect to the role of sensory feedback in coordinated walking. Although feedback is thought to be critical for coordination between legs( Bässler, 1977; Borgmann et al., 2009) most studies address this question using electrophysiology readouts with tethered animals. In addition, with the exception of surgical ablation experiments( Usherwood et al., 1968; Cruse et al., 1984), it has been difficult to dissect the contribution of individual sensory modalities. Gaining further insights into these questions may benefit by the use of systems that use freely walking animals with access to genetic tools to identify and manipulate the individual components of locomotor circuits. The fruit fly, D. melanogaster, is a powerful genetic model with a large collection of mutants and an increasingly sophisticated genetic toolkit( Pfeiffer et al., 2008; Venken et al., 2011). However, despite the availability of powerful genetic tools, there is a lack of quantitative and robust methods to analyze the consequences of manipulating locomotor circuits in the fruit fly. Consequently, many studies focus on relatively low-resolution locomotor assays such as monitoring the average speed of a population, walking trajectories, or the ability to fulfill simple motor tasks such as climbing a vertical surface( Ganetzky and Flanagan, 1978; Branson et al., 2009; Slawson et al., 2009; Robie et al., 2010). To obtain kinematic data, researchers have relied on the manual frame-by-frame analysis of videos( e. g. Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990, 1993; Wosnitza et al., 2012). The lack of a high-resolution and accessible assay to monitor fruit fly walking has greatly limited the use of this model system to study locomotion. In order to quantitatively analyze locomotion in Drosophila, we developed an optical system to monitor walking that uses frustrated Total Internal Reflection( fTIR) coupled with high-speed video imaging. Our fTIR-based method is similar in principle to that used for analyzing the gaits of larger animals( e. g. CatWalk( Vrinten and Hamers, 2003); http://www. noldus. com/animal-behavior-research/products/catwalk/), but differs significantly due to the small size and rapid walking speed of fruit flies. Using this approach, we are able to track the position of each footprint relative to the body at high spatial and temporal resolution as an untethered fly walks freely on a flat surface. Custom analysis software allows the extraction of many parameters of fly walking behavior, including gait, coordination between legs, and footprint positions. Using this method, we comprehensively characterized the walking behavior of wild type animals. Unlike walking in vertebrates, our data demonstrate that flies do not abruptly switch from one gait to another, but instead rely on a continuum of gait patterns that correlate with walking speed. However, several readouts suggest that flies may use distinct neural programs at slow, medium, and fast walking speeds. Genetic manipulations to specifically disrupt sensory feedback from the legs show that blocking proprioception results in altered step parameters and reduced walking precision, especially at slower speeds, but does not interfere with the ability of flies to execute a tripod gait. Together, these data reveal the underlying parameters of wild type walking in Drosophila and show that proprioceptive sensory feedback is important, but not absolutely required, for coordinated locomotion.Discussion:In larger insects such as the stick insect and locust, the role of sensory feedback in coordinated walking has been addressed by local surgical ablations coupled to electrophysiological measurements( Usherwood et al., 1968; Cruse et al., 1984; Akay et al., 2001; Borgmann et al., 2009). For example, using single leg preparations of the stick insect, it was found that for mid and foreleg steps to be out of phase( as they are in wild type walking), stimulation of sensory afferents in the midleg was required; without this stimulation, the CPGs for these legs fired in phase( Borgmann et al., 2009). These, as well as additional observations( Büschges et al., 2008), argue that sensory feedback from legs in stance phase is required for interleg coordination. The use of Drosophila brings an additional set of tools to address these questions. In one set of experiments, we took advantage of a mutation that specifically disrupts the function of the ChOs while a second set of experiments used a combinatorial misexpression approach to inactivate the majority of sensory neurons in the leg, including the ChO, hair plates, campaniform sensilla and mechanosensory bristles. In both sets of experiments, gait parameters and interleg swing phases were largely normal when sensory feedback was impaired. These results suggest that in the fly interleg coordination is not dominated by sensory feedback. Instead, they suggest that communication between CPGs, perhaps by local interneurons, may be sufficient for coordination, a suggestion that is supported by recent studies in vertebrates(( Kiehn, 2011) for review). In insects, interneurons have been implicated in interjoint coordination within individual legs and in footfall placement, but their role in interleg coordination has not been established( Brunn and Dean, 1994; Brunn, 1998; Matheson, 2002). The different requirements for sensory feedback observed here compared to electrophysiology studies in the stick insect may in part be because in our experiments leg sensory neurons were inactivated in all six legs( in the case of 5-40leg>TNT) or all ChOs in the animal( in the case of the nan mutant). We speculate that when all six legs are equally impaired, the flies resort to a CPG and interneuron-dominated system, which is sufficient to execute the tripod gait. Consistent with this notion, although interleg coordination was impaired upon amputation of a single hindleg in Drosophila, the flies were able to recover a partial tripod gait( Wosnitza et al., 2012). The data derived from sensory-deprived flies also supports the idea that flies may be less dependent on sensory feedback when they walk fast because, for several parameters, the defects were significantly more pronounced in slow flies. This observation is consistent with the idea that when flies walk fast, they use a largely sensory-independent CPG-based system where individual CPGs communicate by local interneurons to achieve coordination. In contrast, in slower flies, sensory feedback would be invoked to allow animals to negotiate more complex terrains. These speculations are supported by our observations that several parameters measured here, most prominently footprint clustering, appear distinct at slow, medium, and fast walking speeds. Thus, although the tripod gait is used at all speeds, distinct neural programs may come into play that are more or less dependent on sensory feedback, depending on the speed.","answer":"Most animals need to be able to move to survive . Animals without limbs , such as snakes , move by generating by wave-like contractions along their bodies , whereas limbed animals , such as vertebrates and arthropods , walk by coordinating the movements of multi-jointed arms and legs . Locomotion in limbed animals involves bending each joint within each arm or leg in a coordinated manner , while also ensuring that the movements of all the limbs are coordinated with each other . In bipeds such as humans , for example , it is critical that one leg is in the stance phase when the other leg is in the swing phase . The rules that govern the coordination of limbs also depend on the gait , so the rules for walking are not the same as the rules for running . The nervous systems of bipeds and other animals that walk solve these problems by using complex neural circuits that coordinate the firing of the relevant motor neurons . Two general mechanisms are used to coordinate the firing of motor neurons . In one mechanism , local interneurons within the central nervous system coordinate motor neuron activities: in vertebrates these interneurons are found in the spinal cord . A second mechanism , termed proprioception , relies on sensory neurons that report the load and joint angles from the arms and legs back to the central nervous system , and thereby influence the firing of the motor neurons . Remarkably , both of these mechanisms , and also the types of neurons that comprise motor neuron circuits , are conserved from arthropods to vertebrates . Mendes et al . describe a new approach that can be used to analyze how the fruit fly , D . melanogaster , walks on surfaces . They use a combination of an optical touch sensor and high-speed video imaging to follow the body of the fly as it walks , and also to record when and where it places each of its six feet on the surface as it moves . Then , using a software package called FlyWalker , they are able to extract a large of number of parameters that can be used to describe locomotion in adult fruit flies with high temporal and spatial resolution . Many of these parameters have never been measured or studied before . Mendes et al . show that fruit flies do not display the abrupt transitions in gait that are typically observed in vertebrates . However , they do modify their neural circuits depending on their speed: indeed it appears that flies use subtly different neural circuitry for walking at slow , medium and fast speeds . Moreover , when genetic methods are used to block sensory feedback , the fly is still able to walk , albeit with reduced coordination and precision . Further , the data suggest that proprioception is less important when flies walk faster compared to when they walk more slowly . The next step in this research will be to combine this new method for analyzing locomotion in flies with the wide range of genetic tools that are available for the study of Drosophila: this will allow researchers to explore in greater detail the components of the motor neuron circuitry and their role in coordinated walking ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

normal gait .there is a flexion deformity at the metatarsophallangeal joints of all toes , and complete dorsiflexion of toes is not possible .this may be due to lax extensors that have shown no tendency to spontaneous adjustment in length or tension over the period of time .this can be easily corrected by adjusting the tension of extrinsic extensors of the toes but the patient is satisfied with the reconstruction and has refused the option of undergoing another surgery . according to enneking 's functional scoring system [ table 1 ] used for evaluation outcome following excision of extremity neoplasm ,the patient has slight limp while walking . he does not have a high stepping gait neither does he sway to either side while walking .two and half years after surgery the wounds have settled well , there is no oedema or contractures .there is flexion deformity of toes , but the patient is ambulant and has no complaints lateral view at the same time the revised musculoskeletal tumor society rating scale . enneking et al .the treatment of this tumour is essentially surgical , as malignant transformation has been reported in the literature following radiotherapy . traditionally , curettage with or without bone grafting is the first line of management .although usually effective , it has been associated with a very high ( 1560% ) recurrence rate .most often , recurrence has been reported within 3 years of primary surgery , and is thought to be a persistent disease , rather than recurrence .although some of the lesions classified as stage 1 of enneking 's surgical staging or grade 1 of campanacci 's radiographic grading will recur , curettage may be indicated in those cases because of the lower recurrence rate than in those classified as stage 2 or 3 . however , for stage 2 or 3 , grade 2 or 3 as per the above classifications or postcurettage recurrent lesions , a wide local excision with a 2.5-cm margin is indicated .secondly , due to a small but definite risk of malignant transformation , they should be regularly followed - up . in the case of the resultant large bony defect, there is a wide range of bone and soft tissue reconstructive options , including conventional bone grafting .however , when nonvascularised bone is grafted to a large bony defect , the time required for bone union is significantly extended , especially if the graft is more than 7 cm long . for defects , ranging from 7.5 cm to 12 cm , enneking et al . documented a union rate of 67% , with a stress fracture rate of 17% , at an average of 22 months postoperatively . for defects exceeding 12 cm ,although a union rate of 68% occurred , 30% of the patients required a secondary procedure to achieve this result .furthermore , a stress fracture rate of 58% during an average postoperative period of 21 months occurred .complications of long segmental nonvascularised bone grafts include nonunion , resorption , collapse of the articular segments and fracture of the graft .the foot lacks muscle and soft tissue bulk and may not provide adequate vascularity to the underlying graft .also , the foot , unlike other sites , has to bear weight primarily and is more prone to stress fractures ., we could find only three separate case reports of patients where multiple tarsal bones were involved in giant cell tumour .there are few reports of reconstructions of metatarsal bones with the use of free vascularised fibular grafts following a tumour resection , one of these cases reported excision of five tarsal bones and replacement with nonvascularised iliac bone graft with 7 years of follow - up .autogenous vascularised bone graft for long bone reconstruction after tumour resection was first described by taylor et al .free fibula subsequently has become more popular in limb sparing after long bone tumour resection .the available treatment options in this case were amputation of foot , for which the patient was unwilling .after oncologically sound surgical clearance , the available options for reconstruction were nonvascularised or vascularised bone graft .the length of the defect , thin soft tissue covers and eventual weight - bearing function ruled out the option of nonvascularised bone graft .depending on the size and location of the tumour in the foot , wide surgical margins had to be planned .there are nine foot compartments described in foot for compartmental excision of tumour , but these are not applicable probably for multi - centric tumours . therefore , limb salvage for tumours of the foot is difficult to achieve and requires detailed preoperative assessment to determine the extent of the tumour . in this case , after careful assessment of the scans to rule out soft tissue involvement on table , frozen section biopsy was performed to demonstrate clear margins and complete extra - compartmental excision . the fundamental goal of treatment was improved quality of life by including a functional and durable reconstruction of the musculoskeletal defect .compartmental excision in this case fortunately could be achieved without loss of functionality because of the preservation of substantial neurovascular and tendinous structures as well as skin .intact sensation , especially on the plantar surface , is vital for foot function and skin integrity .we feel that it was a great advantage and has lead the way to early functionality .the first ray is a critical structure in the formation of the tripod of the foot enabling normal gait . during the stance and toe - off phases of the gait cycle ,load bearing focuses on the first ray . a total force of about 119% of body weight acts on the first metatarsal head , making it the most heavily loaded ray of the forefoot .because of the importance of the first ray for weight bearing and propulsion , one strut was attached distally to the first metacarpal and another one to the third metacarpal .the bony contact was good and the fractures united uneventfully in 4 months , and the wires were removed .because of early complete weight bearing , both the struts got fractured but , with minimal rest , these fractures united without any intervention because of the vascularised nature of the graft . also ,after the fracture of the graft , massive amounts of callus were observed on x - ray with remodelling of bone that was found hypertrophied to almost three - times the original size , again indicating good vascularity .after 3.5 years of follow - up , the patient is disease free , the donor and recipient sites have settled well and the patient has residual flexion contracture of toes .the patient limps slightly while walking . he does not have a high stepping gait probably because of restricted motion at the ankle , which prevents full plantar flexion of the ankle jointwe have attempted this reconstruction for salvage of foot extensively involved in giant cell tumour by using a double barrel vascularised fibula .we feel that this method deserves consideration as a last attempt to salvage the functional foot in a disease like this , with an understanding that amputation of the affected limb is the only remaining option in case of any unforeseen complications .","answer":"though giant cell tumor is not uncommon in young adults , simultaneous involvement of multiple mid - foot bones is very uncommon and very difficult to treat . for reconstruction of large segmental bony defects following tumour excision ,  free vascularized bone graft is an excellent surgical option .  we report a case with extensive involvement of all the tarsal bones and metatarsal bases in a young adult . after excision his foot  was reconstructed with vascularised bone flap .  we were able to save his foot after a wide local excision and reconstruction with free fibula graft .  graft united early and showed excellent remodelling because of good vascularity .  we feel that this method deserves consideration as a last attempt to salvage functional foot in disease like this ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

BACKGROUND The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of 90 % for children with bronchiolitis , which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections . No evidence exists to support this threshold . We aimed to assess whether the 90 % or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic 94 % or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis . METHODS We did a parallel-group , randomised , controlled , equivalence trial of infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK ( the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study [ BIDS ] ) . A central computer randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) infants , in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification , to be clipped to standard oximeters ( patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation [ SpO2 ] < 94 % ) or modified oximeters ( displayed a measured value of 90 % as 94 % , therefore oxygen not given until SpO2 < 90 % ) . All parents , clinical staff , and outcome assessors were masked to allocation . The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough ( prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus 2 days ) in the intention-to-treat population . This trial is registered with ISRCTN , number ISRCTN28405428 . FINDINGS Between Oct 3 , and March 30 , 2012 , and Oct 1 , and March 29 , 2013 , we randomly assigned 308 infants to standard oximeters and 307 infants to modified oximeters . Cough resolved by 15·0 days ( median ) in both groups ( 95 % CI for difference -1 to 2 ) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent . We recorded 35 serious adverse events in 32 infants in the standard care group and 25 serious adverse events in 24 infants in the modified care group . In the standard care group , eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit , 23 were readmitted , and one had a prolonged hospital stay . In the modified care group , 12 infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and 12 were readmitted to hospital . Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly . INTERPRETATION Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90 % or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of 94 % or higher . Future research should assess the benefits and risks of different oxygen saturation targets in acute respiratory infection in older children , particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce .

known  hygiene hypothesis  was first proposed by strachan in 1998 and widely received by the world 's medical community .this theory states that microorganisms such as lactobacilli and parasitic worms play an important role in regulating the immune system in the human body as their host .hence , their elimination from modern life leads to diseases induced by deregulation of the immune system such as autoimmune , and allergy .in other words , these biological factors can activate the immune response against them , and prevent or modulate damage to own antigens due to the high antigenic power including the immune system . to confirm the above theory ,the last decade was full of studies investigating the regulation of host immunity at cellular and molecular scales that suggested numerous mechanisms and paths for this regulation .most drugs used , including mitoxantrone , avonex , and beta - interferon are immune modulators and prevent the incidence of symptoms and progress of the disease .given issues discussed , and mechanisms of drugs mentioned , methods that can prevent attacks on self - antigens and the incidence of autoimmune diseases without suppressing the immune system could be effective in control of the disease . in animal models , there is a correlation between parasitic infections and autoimmune diseases such as ms , and these infections can cause modulation of the immune system , and consequently remitting the symptoms of autoimmune diseases . in this study we aimed to compare the frequency of blood tissue parasitic infections in patients with ms as compared to their family members .this descriptive - analytical study was conducted on 50 relapsing - remitting ms patients resident in isfahan province and 50 family members cohabiting with the patients , attending ms clinic at alzahra hospital .the study commenced after explaining the objectives of the project , completing the questionnaires and obtaining their written consents . to prepare serums for measuring igm and igg anti - toxoplasma gondii, blood samples were centrifuged without the anticoagulation agent , and serums were tested for anti - t .gondii igg and igm antibodies titers by commercially available enzyme immunoassays ( euroimmun , germany ) with an automatic microplate spectrophotometer ( bio -

square and student 's t - test was used to test statistically significant differences .the distribution of igg antibody titers of serum samples measured by elisa is shown in table 1 .a total of 18 patients and 24 of their family members had a positive test in igg t. gondii .chi - square test revealed not significant differences between the two groups . in both groups, there was no positive igm t. gondii , indicating the absence of active disease in the two groups .of the total population , 42.4% of tests are positive igg t. gondii ( p = 0.09 ) .comparison of the results of the igm and igg elisa in the case and control groups the mean duration of ms disease in the participants that tested positive for igg t. gondii was 44.6  10.1 months , and for the participants with negative test results , the mean duration was 44.3  8.9 months .independent t -

square test showed no significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.25 ) .nine persons in patient 's group and 22 in the control group had a history of parasitic diseases .the chi - square test showed that this difference was not significant ( p = 0.05 ) .a history of parasitic disease in the case group 18.4% and the control group was 44.9% . a significant relationship between a parasitic disease history and risk of ms between the two groups was observed ( p = 0.001 ) .in this study , attempts were made to examine the relationship between ms and a few parasitic diseases .this current information reflects the endemicity of protozoan blood and tissue infections in 50 ms patients and 50 family members of these patients . in both groups, there was no positive igm t. gondii , indicating the absence of active disease in the two groups .it was reported that t. gondii seroprevalence ranges from 12% to 91% in iranian population . in the present study, we have shown that the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in patients and their family members was 36% and 49% respectively .this rate was similar to previous data of mostafavi et al . who reported a 41.4% positive rate in isfahan ( center of iran ) in the total population . in man , evidence of infectionhas been found in all population groups investigated prevalence rates vary from place to place .the prevalence of toxoplasmosis is related to several factors , including culture , nutritional habits and type of diet , age , and a rural or urban setting .drinking contaminated water , the role of domestic and cats has been not fully assessed .the results shed light the relationship between these diseases and a mismatch with hypotheses examined .however , considering that the prevalence of toxoplasmosis , leishmaniasis , and malaria varies with time , and depends on numerous epidemiological factors , hence , at the time of this study , this rate was low in the control group , as well .it is recommended that these theories should be verified with a larger sample size , or by infecting animal models with these parasites to examine the clinical changes in ms disease in them .our results showed a mismatch with hygiene hypotheses examined . however , considering that the prevalence of parasites varies with time , and depends on numerous epidemiological factors ; these results do not discredit the theory investigated .","answer":"background : multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system which has been identifies more prevalent in economically developed countries than in the developing countries .  low prevalence of parasitic infections ( which can activate immune response and prevent or modulate damage to host antigens ) in these areas is among the possible responsible factors for such a difference . in this study we aimed to compare frequency of blood -

Although the well-known poly(ADP-ribosylating) (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many noncanonical mono(ADP-ribosylating) (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust up-regulation of several PARPs following infection with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly up-regulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while down-regulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD(+) and NADP(+) Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM, and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Mechanism\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Lower cardiovascular disease mortality is likely the primary reason for their better survival rates. On the other hand, there are inconsistent results among studies of power (anaerobic) athletes.","answer":"longer than the general population, or No clear results indicating improved life expectancy in professional athletes"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Unlike small molecule fluorophores, conjugated polymers feature a molecular wire effect and polyvalent modes of interactions that can enhance signal generation.1,2 Moreover, conjugated polymer chains with multiple recognition elements can bind to one analyte molecule, thereby increasing both the binding efficiency and recognition selectivity for specific analytes.3</p><p>The favorable properties of conjugated polymers have facilitated their applications in biosensing and bioimaging. As an example, the heparin-like properties of a highly negatively charged PPE were shown by staining of hamster fibroblast cells, where PPE binds selectively to fibronectin due to significant electrostatic interactions.4 Recent studies on cell labeling using polymers5,6 suggest that conjugated polymers could provide an effective platform for cell sensing, including the detection of cancer cells.</p><p>Existing methods for cancer cell detection are in general based on antibody array7,8 and DNA microarray9 techniques, and rely on variations in intra- and extracellular protein biomarkers and mutations in genome, respectively. While antibody-based arrays have been quite successful in early detection of cancers, they require the availability of specific markers for different cancers, a situation that is not the case with many cancers.10 There is therefore a need for the development of new biosensor strategies for the detection of cancer cells that can distinguish between cell lines based on more subtle differences.</p><p>Chemical nose-based sensor array approaches11 that exploit differential receptor-analyte binding interactions provide an alternative to lock-and-key approaches that use specific recognition processes. \\"Electronic noses/tongues\\" have been employed for a wide variety of analytes, including metal ions,12 volatile agents,13 aromatic amines,14 amino acids,15 carbohydrates16 and proteins.17 While array approaches are quite useful for detection of specific analytes, the sensitivity of these systems to subtle changes in analyte ratios makes them particularly promising for cell sensing applications, as demonstrated by the use of nanoparticle-polymer systems to identify bacteria18 and mammalian cell types.19 In this contribution, we exploit the environmentally responsive fluorescence of poly(paraphenyleneethynylene)s (PPE) to provide an array-based sensing system (Figure 1) that can differentiate between cell types as well as discern cancerous from non-cancerous mammalian cells. In our approach, we use a differential affinity-based approach as opposed to specific biomarker recognition. The major advantage of this approach is that we do not require knowledge of specific ligands or receptors to differntiate between cell types and states.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Polymers P1-P8 were synthesized as reported previously.20 The NT2 cell line was obtained from Prof. R. Thomas Zoeller (Biology Department, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, USA). All the cells were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics in T75 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were regularly passaged by trypsinization with 0.1% trypsin (EDTA 0.02%, dextrose 0.05%, and trypsin 0.1%) in PBS (pH 7.2).</p>Cell sensing studies<p>Cells grown in T75 flasks were washed with DPBS buffer, trypsinized with 1X trypsin and collected in the DMEM media. Cells were spun down, re-suspended in DMEM media (without serum proteins/antibiotics) and counted using hemocytometer. The polymers were dissolved in DPBS buffer (1 ×) to make 100 nM of stock solutions on the basis of their molecular weights. 200 μL of each polymer solution in DPBS was loaded into a well on a 96-well plate (300 μL WhatmanR) and the fluorescence intensity values at 465 nm was recorded on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 microplate reader with excitation at 430 nm. 10 μL of cell suspension (5,000 cells) was added to each well. The fluorescence intensity values at 465 nm were recorded again. The ratio of the final response to initial fluorescence response before and after addition of cells was treated as the fluorescence response. This process was repeated firstly for four different cancer cell types to generate six replicates of each. We have tested 4 cell types against the eight-polymer array (P1-P8) six times, to generate training data matrix of 8 polymers × 4 cell types × 6 replicates. Similarly, a training matrix of 8 polymers × 3 cell types × 6 replicates was generated for three Isogenic cell types. We have used the same volume and concentration of DMEM media for all cell type experiments under identical conditions. Therefore the changes due to DMEM media alone would be same for all the experiments.</p>LDA analysis<p>The raw data matrix was processed using classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in SYSTAT (version 11.0).21,22 In LDA, all variables were used in the model (complete mode) and the tolerance was set as 0.001. The raw fluorescence response patterns were transformed to canonical patterns where the ratio of between-class variance to the within-class variance was maximized according to the pre-assigned grouping. In a blind experiment, the rates of fluorescence patterns of new case were first converted to canonical scores using discriminate functions established on training samples. Mahalanobis distance23,24 is the distance of a case to the centroid of a group in a multidimensional space and was calculated for the new case to the centroid of respective groups (normal or cancerous or metastatic cells) of training samples. The new case was assigned to the group with shortest Mahalanobis distance. This processing protocol was performed on the SYSTAT 11 program, allowing the assignment of cells to specific groups.</p>Results and Discussion<p>As a starting point for our studies we have chosen eight conjugated fluorescent polymers (Figure 2) based on a common PPE backbone. These PPEs are water soluble, fluorescent and structurally diverse, possessing various charge characteristics and differing degrees of polymerization. Our hypothesis was that these characteristics should provide these polymers with selective binding properties, and hence differential interactions with different cell surfaces. (Figure 1) These differential interactions involve the electrostatic interactions between the cationic/anionic polymers and cell surface functionality, e.g. lipids, proteins and polysaccharides. These interactions lead to different aggregation behaviors of polymers on the cell surfaces resulting in variation of the polymer fluorescence that can be analyzed by LDA analysis to discriminate different cell types and states.</p><p>We have selected four different human cancerous cell lines and three isogenic cells lines. (Table 1) for our studies. Each of these cell types has a different function that would be expected to be manifested in surface functionality in practice. The isogenic breast cell lines provide a particularly valid testbed for our sensor array, as these cells differ only in cell state, providing a model for detection of cancer in clinical settings.</p><p>In practice, we first titrated the polymers with different concentrations of cell suspensions to determine the sensitivity of the array. The fluorescence titration studies showed the required sensitivity using 5 × 103 cells (see SI) so that final cell concentration of cells would be 5 × 103 cells/210 μL. In all the further experiments, this concentration of cells was used. The fluorescence of the PPE solution (100 nM, on the basis of number-average molecular weight) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was recorded. Then 5 × 103 cells in 10µL of DMEM media were added to the PPE and the mixture was incubated for 30 min and the fluorescence of the polymer recorded again. The experiments were performed with eight polymers in 6-replicates. The fluorescence response patterns were generated from the ratio of final and initial fluorescence of the polymers. The fluorescence intensity of all of the samples decreases upon exposure to the mammalian cells due to polyvalent interactions of polymers with cell surfaces. To sort out the fluorescence responses that provide the discriminating signatures, we classified the fluorescence data set for all the 8 polymers using classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) using SYSTAT software (version 11). This statistical analysis method is used to recognize the linear combination of features that differentiate two or more classes of objects or events. Stepwise analysis with different polymer set(s) (i.e. jackknifed classification) was used to determine which polymer set could best differentiate between the cells. The Jackknifed classification matrix is an attempt to approximate cross-validation. The Jackknifed classification matrix use functions computed from all of the data except the case being classified. Figure 3 presents the Jackknifed classification matrix for all different set of cell lines using different combinations of polymers. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, we pick out different combinations logically ruling out the cases that lead to less separation. Then we consider the combinations containing least number of polymers. We observed the maximum differentiation grouping using four common polymers (P2, P2, P3, P5) in the present study. Next, we subjected the data obtained from different cancer cell types and isogenic cell to LDA analysis using these common set of particles to determine the separation within each class (vide infra).</p><p>Figure 4a presents the fluorescence response of the four cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, NT2 and HepG2) to polymers P1, P2, P3, and P5. The LDA analysis converts the patterns of training matrix (4 polymers × 4 cell lines × 6 replicates) to canonical scores. The first three canonical factors contain 96.7, 3.0 and 0.3% of variance as shown in Figure 4b. In this plot, each point represents the response pattern for a single cell type to the polymer sensor array. In the canonical fluorescence response patterns, the different cell types are clustered into four non-overlapping groups (95% level confidence ellipses) (Figure 4b), indicating the ability of this set of polymers to differentiate between the four different cancer cell types using simple polymer array.</p><p>These initial results validate our ability to differentiate cell types phenotypically based on their surface properties. A much more challenging goal is to differentiate cells based on cell state, i.e. the differentiation between genetically identical healthy, cancerous, and metastatic cells. To determine the ability of our sensors to detect and identify cancer, we used three cell lines from genetically identical BALB/c mice (Table 1). CDBgeo cells were prepared by retroviral infection with a marker gene encoding the fusion of β-galactosidase and neomycin resistance. These cells exhibit normal outgrowths when transplanted into mammary fat pads. The TD cells were prepared by treating CDBgeo-cells with 10 ng/mL TGF-β for 14 days,25 withdrawal for five passages resulted in a persistent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation: tumorogenic growth resulted when transplanted. The V14 cell line was established from a primary mammary tumor arising in BALB/c-Trp53+/- mice.26 The cells lack p53 protein and form aggressive tumors that are locally invasive in mice. Therefore, CDBgeo and TD cells differ from each other just a single cell-state transformation. As an example, V14 is different from CDBgeo and TD in just lacking the p53 tumor suppressor gene.</p><p>The three cell lines (CDBgeo, TD, and V14) were screened with the eight PPEs; the jackknifed analysis (Figure 3b) indicates that optimal differentiation (94%) was achieved using the same four polymers as before, i.e. P1, P2, P3 and P5. Figure 5a shows the fluorescence patterns obtained from four polymers P1, P2, P3 and P5 upon their incubation with isogenic cell types. These patterns were reproducible and subjected to LDA analysis (Figure 5b) generating the training matrix of 4 polymers × 3 cell types × 6 replicates with first two factors of 96.3 and 3.7% of variance respectively with 94% accuracy. Therefore, using this array based approach we can discriminate the subtle changes between different cell states, providing a model for cancer detection in clinical applications.</p><p>The robustness of the polymer array system was tested using unknowns generated from the three isogenic cell lines. The fluorescence response patterns generated were subjected to LDA analysis. During LDA, the cell types were classified to the groups generated through the training matrix according to their shortest Mahalonobis distances to respective groups. In these studies we observed 80% accuracy of unknown samples (19 out of 24).</p><p>Analysis of the combined results indicates that four polymers (P1, P2, P3 and P5) out of the original eight can distinguish different mammalian cells effectively. Of the four polymers P1-4 are cationic and would hence be expected to interact with the negatively charged cell membrane. Significantly, polymer length is important, as P3 and P4 have the same structure, but only the longer P3 was effective at differentiation, suggesting that polyvalency is an important consideration in differentiation. Polymers P5-8 are anionic in nature, and their interaction with the cells is not clear. It is worth noting, however, that the least charged anionic polymer (P5) was most effective at cell differentiation.</p>Conclusions<p>In summary, we have developed a conjugated fluorescent polymer PPE-based sensor array and demonstrated its utility in cell sensing. Using this sensor array, we can distinguish between several cancer cell types as well as between isogenic healthy, cancerous, and metastatic cells that possess the same genetic background. Taken together, these studies provide an effective sensor for differentiating cell types, as well as provide a potential direction in the creation of polymer-based imaging agents and delivery vehicles based on differential cell interactions; and \\"nose\\" based polymer sensor arrays are new ways for diagnostic, biophysical and surface science processes involving cell surfaces.</p>","answer":"A family of conjugated fluorescent polymers was used to create an array for cell sensing.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 4131 COVID-19 positive adult patients who were admitted to 3 tertiary care hospitals of an academic medical center at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City from March 1, 2020, to May 10, 2020, to identify patients who had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. We evaluated the MRIs in detail, and identified a subset of patients with leukoencephalopathy and/or cerebral microbleeds. We compared clinical, laboratory, and functional outcomes for these patients to patients who had a brain MRI that did not show these findings. RESULTS: Of 115 patients who had an MRI of the brain performed, 35 (30.4%) patients had leukoencephalopathy and/or cerebral microbleeds. Patients with leukoencephalopathy and/or cerebral microbleeds had neuroimaging performed later during the hospitalization course (27 versus 10.6 days; P<0.001), were clinically sicker at the time of brain MRI (median GCS 6 versus 14; P<0.001), and had higher peak D-dimer levels (8018+/-6677 versus 3183+/-3482; P<0.001), lower nadir platelet count (116.9+/-62.2 versus 158.3+/-76.2; P=0.03), higher peak international normalized ratio (2.2 versus 1.57; P<0.001) values when compared with patients who had a brain MRI that did not show these findings. They required longer ventilator support (34.6 versus 9.1 days; P<0.001) and were more likely to have moderate and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome score (88.6% versus 23.8%, P<0.001). These patients had longer hospitalizations (42.1 versus 20.9 days; P<0.001), overall worse functional status on discharge (mRS 5 versus 4; P=0.001), and higher mortality (20% versus 9%; P=0.144).

Influenza viruses had caused a pandemic globally during 1918 and 1919, and that influenza pandemic had taken away more than 20 million people's lives in the world. However, in my opinion, it is unlikely that influenza viruses will again cause a pandemic on a level (both of the morbidity rate and the mortality rate) comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Influenza viruses very easily reassort, recombine, and point mutate in nature due to their segmented RNA genome structures, however, unlike highly pathogenic (virulent) viruses like rabies virus, Lassa fever virus, smallpox virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1); most influenza viruses (wild types and mutants) are moderately pathogenic. The case fatality rates of some highly virulent viruses and related references are listed in Table 1 . On November 11, 1918 , the fighting of World War I was stopped, and World War I was officially ended on June 28, 1919 with the signing of the Versailles Treaty. It is estimated that around 8.5-10 million soldiers lost their lives in World War I due to battle. The war also directly caused more than 6 million civilian deaths. Millions of people suffered from hunger and malnutrition during the war. Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time. For example, about 700,000 Germans died from malnutrition-related diseases in the years of 1914-1918. During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide. Those people were killed both directly and indirectly by influenza virus infections. Many families were too poor to buy food and coal, and to afford health care expenses when their family members were ill. Influenza virus could infect all members of a family, and this could result in no one left to feed the fires, and to prepare food for the whole family, even if they had firewood, coal, and food left in their homes. Sadly, a large number of people died of influenza virus infections along with starvation, cold, and poor living conditions (8) . In recent years, while hunger and malnutrition are not major and serious problems in some developed countries anymore, they are still very difficult to overcome in many developing countries. In these less-developed countries, there were approximately 925 million people who suffered from hunger; 125 million children were underweight; and 195 million children were stunted each year (9) . Nevertheless, in comparison to 1918 and 1919, currently, we have much better social and economic conditions and public health systems globally; and generally speaking, the majority of people in the world have better nutritional and educational statuses; better living and working conditions; therefore, better general health and immunity. Furthermore, in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. Today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like Tylenol or Advil. We do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time. Actually, in the United States of America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons (10) . Because of the above reasons, we can optimistically assume that even the same strain of influenza virus, which caused pandemic in 1918 and 1919, would not be able to kill millions of people and cause a pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 pandemic again in the future. Additionally, a significant number of viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie B virus, echovirus, and metapneumovirus (11, 12) . Some of the above-mentioned viruses like adenovirus and mutated coronavirus could cause problems that are comparable to influenza viruses (13, 14) . The World Health Organization (WHO) mistakenly raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to the highest phase 6 on June 11, 2009 (15) . However, the truth was that most cases of H1N1 influenza A virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in New Zealand (16) ; and in New York City, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) . Some researchers argued that it should not have been called an influenza pandemic in the first place if the clinical severity was considered (15, (18) (19) (20) . I believe it was unwise that we had paid too much www.frontiersin.org 23) . Not surprisingly, every year there would be some influenza patients and a few of them would die from the infections, as it is almost impossible to eliminate influenza viruses from the natural environment in many years. The severity of a viral infection is determined by both of the viral virulence (pathogenicity) and the host immunity. Some researchers' opinions on H7N9 avian influenza virus were incorrect and/or inadequate. They mainly focused on influenza viruses and worried about viral mutations, viral pathogenicity, viral adaptation, and transmission. They overestimated the negative part of socio-economic factors of the present east China: overcrowded population in the epidemic region; very busy national and international transportation and travel; a large number of live poultry markets . . . but they underestimated the currently changed, developed, and improved positive part of socio-economic factors in China. The following factors might be used to explain why that H7N9 influenza A virus epidemic was limited and controlled in China, and only a few immunocompromised patients were killed by H7N9 influenza A virus. First, China has a relatively organized and effective public health system, there are four levels of (national, provincial, prefectural-level city, and county) centers for disease control and prevention all over China (24) . Second, physicians and nurses in China were prepared and knowledgeable of influenza virus infections. Third, samples from patients with suspected influenza virus infections were collected and sent to the local and national centers for disease control and prevention promptly. H7N9 influenza A viruses were isolated and identified very quickly. Thereby, they were able to diagnose, confirm, and report three cases of H7N9 influenza patients in the early stage of the epidemic (24, 25) . Fourth, health care and public health workers were protected properly. Consequently, none of the health professionals was infected by H7N9 influenza A virus in 2013. However, a surgeon died of H7N9 influenza in Shanghai, China in January of 2014 (26) . Fifth, they detected H7N9 influenza A viruses from the samples of chickens, pigeons, and the environment of live poultry markets in Shanghai (27) ; and closed the live poultry markets of the involved epidemic region quickly. Sixth, patients were isolated and treated timely in hospitals, 74% (1251/1689) of those close contacts of H7N9 influenza patients were monitored and observed. Thus, H7N9 influenza A virus could not spread to a bigger population (24) . Last but not least, we are connected to the Internet now, and it seems that our planet is much smaller today than the earlier days when we did not have the Internet, because communication and information exchange have become so fast, easy, and convenient presently. During that avian influenza epidemic, some influenza experts in the world shared/exchanged H7N9 influenza A virus information and provided professional consultations and suggestions efficiently and rapidly. All these public health routine practices and measures resulted in that H7N9 influenza epidemic being controlled and stopped in China (24) . I have to point out that the cases of diagnosed H7N9 avian influenza A virus infection might only be the tip of the iceberg. Aside from one laboratory confirmed asymptotic case of H7N9 influenza A virus infection in Beijing (22), there were probably many undetected mild or asymptotic cases of influenza A H7N9 infection. The reason is that most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong) (22, 23). Nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other RNA viruses.  However, we are now living in a technologically, economically, and socially much better and advanced society. I believe influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. Now, I first predict that influenza viruses will unlikely again cause a pandemic on a level comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Hopefully, one day we could consider a strategy to produce a universal vaccine that can prevent people from infections of all influenza virus strains, or we could produce some very effective anti-influenza virus drugs; then influenza would not be a problem anymore. We should learn lessons from the mistakes we made in the past. It is reasonable and necessary to be cautious about influenza viruses, but overreactions or catastrophic reactions should be avoided in the future. My opinion is anti-traditional; the purpose of this article is to influence public health policy, and to save some of the limited resources and money for more important diseases like heart diseases, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, hepatitises, and tuberculosis (15) .

Ultrafine tungsten nanocrystals (average size of 3 nm) with a metastable phase (beta-tungsten with A15 structure, β-W) have been prepared by laser ablation of tungsten in liquid nitrogen. The as-prepared metastable nanocrystals exhibited super-stablity, and can keep the same metastable structure over a period of 6 months at room temperature. This super-stability is attributed to the nanosized confinement effect of ultrafine nanocrystals. The magnetism measurements showed that the β-W nanocrystals have weak ferromagnetic properties at 2 K, which may arise from surface defects and unpaired electrons on the surface of the ultrafine nanocrystals. These findings provided useful information for the application of ultrafine β-W nanocrystals in microelectronics and spintronics.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that rTMS given as continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), repeated monthly for one year, would affect ALS progression. We performed a double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty patients with ALS were randomly allocated to blinded real or placebo stimulation. cTBS of the motor cortex was performed for five consecutive days every month for one year. Primary outcome was the rate of decline as evaluated with the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). Treatment was well tolerated. There was no significant difference in the ALSFRS-R score deterioration between patients treated with real or placebo stimulation. ALSFRS-R mean scores declined from 32.0 (SD 7.1) at study entry to 23.1 (SD 6.3) at 12 months in patients receiving real cTBS and from 31.3 (SD 6.9) to 21.2 (SD 6.0) in those receiving placebo stimulation. Although cTBS proved a safe procedure, on the basis of the present findings a larger randomized confirmatory trial seems unjustified in ALS patients, at least in advanced stage of the disease.Title 2:The effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor performance, fatigue and quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Abstract 2:The treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is still disappointing. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been suggested to modify the rate of disease progression in ALS.                In a pilot controlled study, we tested the effect of 5-Hz rTMS on motor performance, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in ALS.                Ten ALS patients underwent a two-week period of daily active or sham 5-Hz rTMS. Outcome measures were assessed with functional, fatigue and QoL scales. Muscle strength was evaluated with the MRC scale and measured with isometric and isokinetic dynamometer.                Significant difference at the end of rTMS treatment was found for QoL, maximum voluntary isometric contraction and isokinetic average power when comparing active vs sham treatment. These changes were transitory and outcome measures were not significant two weeks after discontinuation of rTMS.                Though preliminary, our results suggest that 5-Hz rTMS may improve motor function and QoL in ALS. The present data indicate the need of a double-blind therapeutic trial of rTMS in ALS.Title 3:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for ALS. A preliminary controlled study.Abstract 3:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of brain can modulate cortical neurotransmission, a novel paradigm of repetitive stimulation termed continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) produces a pronounced and prolonged suppression of motor cortex excitability. The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate whether cTBS of motor cortex could have any beneficial effect in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty patients with definite ALS were randomly allocated to blinded active or placebo stimulation. Repetitive stimulation of the motor cortex was performed for five consecutive days every month for six consecutive months. The primary outcome was the rate of decline as evaluated with the ALS functional rating scale. The treatment was well tolerated by the patients. Fifteen patients (seven active and eight sham) completed the study and were included in the 6-months analysis. Both active and sham patients deteriorated during treatment, however, active patients showed a modest but significant slowing of the deterioration rate. Though we cannot be sure whether the effects observed can be attributed to cTBS, because of the restricted number of patients studied, further investigation on a larger group of ALS patients is warranted. The results of the pilot study might open up a new therapeutic perspective in ALS based on neuromodulation.","answer":"There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of ALS.

Wecompare the theoretical representational capacity of the two meta-learning approaches: a deep network updated with one gradient step, and a meta-learner that directly ingests a training set and test input and outputs predictions for that test input (e.g. using a recurrent neural network). Instudying the universality of MAML, we find that, for a sufficiently deep learner model, MAML has the same theoretical representational power as recurrent meta-learners. Wetherefore conclude that, when using deep, expressive function approximators, there is no theoretical disadvantage in terms of representational power to using MAML over a black-box meta-learner represented, for example, by a recurrent network.Since MAML has the same representational power as any other universal meta-learner, the next question we might ask is: what is the benefit of using MAML over any other approach? Westudy this question by analyzing the effect of continuing optimization on MAML performance. AlthoughMAML optimizes a network's parameters for maximal performance after a fixed small number of gradient steps, we analyze the effect of taking substantially more gradient steps at meta-test time. We findthat initializations learned by MAML are extremely resilient to overfitting to tiny datasets, in stark contrast to more conventional network initialization, even when taking many more gradient steps than were used during meta-training. We alsofind that the MAML initialization is substantially better suited for extrapolation beyond the distribution of tasks seen at meta-training time, when compared to meta-learning methods based on networks that ingest the entire training set. We analyzethis setting empirically and provide some intuition to explain this effect.In this paper, we show that there exists a form of deep neural network such that the initial weights combined with gradient descent can approximate any learning algorithm.Our findings suggest that, from the standpoint of expressivity, there is no theoretical disadvantage to embedding gradient descent into the meta-learning process.In fact, in all of our experiments, we found that the learning strategies acquired with MAML are more successful when faced with out-of-domain tasks compared to recurrent learners.Furthermore, we show that the representations acquired with MAML are highly resilient to overfitting.These results suggest that gradient-based meta-learning has a num-ber of practical benefits, and no theoretical downsides in terms of expressivity when compared to alternative meta-learning models.Independent of the type of meta-learning algorithm, we formalize what it means for a meta-learner to be able to approximate any learning algorithm in terms of its ability to represent functions of the dataset and test inputs.This formalism provides a new perspective on the learning-to-learn problem, which we hope will lead to further discussion and research on the goals and methodology surrounding meta-learning.While there are likely a number of ways to prove Lemma 4.1 (copied below for convenience), here we provide a simple, though inefficient, proof of Lemma 4.1.Lemma 4.1 Let us assume that e(y) can be chosen to be any linear (but not affine) function of y.Then, we can choose θ ft , θ h , {A i ; i > 1}, {B i ; i < N } such that the function DISPLAYFORM0 can approximate any continuous function of (x, y, x ) on compact subsets of R dim(y) .","answer":"Deep representations combined with gradient descent can approximate any learning algorithm."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

METHODS: We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. RESULTS: Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged; the incubation period was 3-7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 degrees C). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others had ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) were exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir because of adverse effects, two of them deteriorated, one was hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir use. Levels of potassium, albumin, and lymphocytes were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 7-9 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement. The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir use.

Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE) -dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL) -1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.","answer":"[[\\"Gemfibrozil\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"inducible nitric-oxide synthase\\"], [\\"nitric-oxide\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"clofibrate\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"Gemfibrozil\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"NO\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"NO\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"inducible nitric-oxide synthase\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"PPAR-alpha\\"], [\\"Gemfibrozil\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"nitric-oxide synthase\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"C/EBPbeta\\"], [\\"fibrate\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"nitric-oxide\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"inducible nitric-oxide synthase\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"PPAR-alpha\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"nitric-oxide\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"nitric-oxide synthase\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"NF-kappaB\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha\\"], [\\"gemfibrozil\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"AP-1\\"], [\\"Gemfibrozil\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"peroxisome proliferator-responsive element\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimise the extraction conditions for flavonoids from fructus sophorae with advantages in terms of resisting flavonoids during the whole process and maximising of extraction yield. Three aglycon forms of the flavonoids, namely, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) to estimate extraction yield. The combined effects of independent variables were studied and the optimal extraction conditions were obtained as ethanol concentration, 74.47%; solid-liquid ratio, 17.99 ml/g; temperature, 89.13°C; and extraction time, 2.10h. The reliability of the method was confirmed by recovery experiments, performed under optimal conditions. Recoveries indicated that flavonoids resisted the extraction conditions. The experimental extraction yield under optimal conditions was found to be 10.459%, which was well matched with the predicted values of 10.461%.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"isorhamnetin\\", \\"flavonoids\\", \\"quercetin\\", \\"ethanol\\", \\"kaempferol\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We introduce a Task Conflict-Based Search (TCBS) Algorithm to solve the combined delivery task allocation and multi-agent path planning problem optimally. The problem is known to be NP-hard and the optimal solver cannot scale. However, we introduce it as a baseline to evaluate the sub-optimality of other approaches. We show experimental results that compare our solver with different sub-optimal ones in terms of regret.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: We consider a graph with n vertices, and p<n pebbles of m colors. A pebble move consists of transferring a pebble from its current host vertex to an adjacent unoccupied vertex. The problem is to move the pebbles to a given new color arrangement.[3]: [4]: An algorithm for path planning to a goal with a mobile robot in an unknown environment is presented. The robot maps the environment only to the extent necessary to achieve the goal. Mapping is achieved using tactile sensing while the robot is executing a path to the specified goal. Paths are generated by treating unknown regions in the environment as free space. As obstacles are encountered en route to a goal, the model of the environment is updated and a new path to the goal is planned and executed. Initially the paths to the goal generated by this algorithm will be negotiable paths. However, as the robot acquires more knowledge about the environment, the length of the planned paths will be optimized. The optimization criteria can be modified to favor or avoid unexplored regions in the environment. The algorithm makes use of the quadtree data structure to model the environment and uses the distance transform methodology to generate paths for the robot to execute. >[5]: In this paper we address the demand for flexibility and economic efficiency in industrial autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) systems by the use of cloud computing. We propose a cloud-based architecture that moves parts of mapping, localization and path planning tasks to a cloud server. We use a cooperative longterm Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approach which merges environment perception of stationary sensors and mobile robots into a central Holistic Environment Model (HEM). Further, we deploy a hierarchical cooperative path planning approach using Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to find optimal sets of paths which are then provided to the mobile robots. For communication we utilize the Manufacturing Service Bus (MSB) which is a component of the manufacturing cloud platform Virtual Fort Knox (VFK). We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in a real-life industrial scenario. Additionally, we evaluate the system's communication and the planner for various numbers of agents.[6]: [7]: One of the standing challenges in multi-robot systems is the ability to reliably coordinate motions of multiple robots in environments where the robots are subject to disturbances. We consider disturbances that force the robot to temporarily stop and delay its advancement along its planned trajectory which can be used to model, e.g., passing-by humans for whom the robots have to yield. Although reactive collision-avoidance methods are often used in this context, they may lead to deadlocks between robots. We design a multi-robot control strategy for executing coordinated trajectories computed by a multi-robot trajectory planner and give a proof that the strategy is safe and deadlock-free even when robots are subject to delaying disturbances. Our simulations show that the proposed strategy scales significantly better with the intensity of disturbances than the naive liveness-preserving approach. The empirical results further confirm that the proposed approach is more reliable and also more efficient than state-of-the-art reactive techniques.[8]: Cooperative pathfinding is a problem of finding a set of non-conflicting trajectories for a number of mobile agents. Its applications include planning for teams of mobile robots, such as autonomous aircrafts, cars, or underwater vehicles. The state-of-the-art algorithms for cooperative pathfinding typically rely on some heuristic forward-search pathfinding technique, where A* is often the algorithm of choice. Here, we propose MA-RRT*, a novel algorithm for multi-agent path planning that builds upon a recently proposed asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithm for finding single-agent shortest path called RRT*. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the algorithm and show that the sampling-based approach offers better scalability than the classical forward-search approach in relatively large, but sparse environments, which are typical in real-world applications such as multi-aircraft collision avoidance.[9]: In this paper, we study the structure and computational complexity of optimal multi-robot path planning problems on graphs. Our results encompass three formulations of the discrete multi-robot path planning problem, including a variant that allows synchronous rotations of robots along fully occupied, disjoint cycles on the graph. Allowing rotation of robots provides a more natural model for multi-robot path planning because robots can communicate. Our optimality objectives are to minimize the total arrival time, the makespan (last arrival time), and the total distance. On the structure side, we show that, in general, these objectives demonstrate a pairwise Pareto optimal structure and cannot be simultaneously optimized. On the computational complexity side, we extend previous work and show that, regardless of the underlying multi-robot path planning problem, these objectives are all intractable to compute. In particular, our NP-hardness proof for the time optimal versions, based on a minimal and direct reduction from the 3-satisfiability problem, shows that these problems remain NP-hard even when there are only two groups of robots (i.e. robots within each group are interchangeable).[10]: We address the problem of optimal pathfinding for multiple agents. Given a start state and a goal state for each of the agents, the task is to find minimal paths for the different agents while avoiding collisions. Previous work on solving this problem optimally, used traditional single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm. We present a novel formalization for this problem which includes a search tree called the increasing cost tree (ICT) and a corresponding search algorithm, called the increasing cost tree search (ICTS) that finds optimal solutions. ICTS is a two-level search algorithm. The high-level phase of ICTS searches the increasing cost tree for a set of costs (cost per agent). The low-level phase of ICTS searches for a valid path for every agent that is constrained to have the same cost as given by the high-level phase. We analyze this new formalization, compare it to the A* search formalization and provide the pros and cons of each. Following, we show how the unique formalization of ICTS allows even further pruning of the state space by grouping small sets of agents and identifying unsolvable combinations of costs. Experimental results on various domains show the benefits and limitations of our new approach. A speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude was obtained in some cases.[11]: Autonomous robot teams that simultaneously dispatch transportation tasks are playing more and more an important role in present logistic centers and manufacturing plants. In this paper we consider the problem of robot motion planning for large robot teams in the industrial domain. We present adaptive road map optimization (ARMO) that is capable of adapting the road map whenever the environment has changed. Based on linear programming, ARMO computes an optimal road map configuration according to environmental constraints (including human whereabouts) and the demand for transportation tasks from loading stations in the plant. For detecting dynamic changes, the environment is described by a grid map augmented with a hidden Markov model (HMM). We show experimentally that ARMO outperforms decoupled planning in terms of computation time and time needed for task completion.","answer":"MAPF is another intensively studied problem in multi-agent systems [3] .

A link between this heavy metal treatment and Stat3 signaling pathways was examined in primary mouse hepatocytes. We provided evidence of a novel link among NADPH oxidase and Stat3 signaling, mediated by Src, EGFR, and Erk1/2. Cadmium activates NADPH oxidase. ROS produced by this oxidase activates Src, enable that in turn, transactivates EGFR that activates Stat3 in tyrosine, allowing its dimerization. Also, ROS from NADPH oxidase favors ERK1/2 activation that phosphorylates Stat3 in serine, resulting in a compensatory or adaptive survival response such as production of metallothionein-II in short Cd exposure times. However, after 12h CdCl2 treatment, cell viability diminished in 50%, accompanied by a drastic decrease of metallothionein-II production, and an increase in p53 activation and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"NADPH\\", \\"serine\\", \\"cadmium\\", \\"tyrosine\\", \\"Cadmium\\", \\"Cd\\", \\"CdCl2\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"ERK1/2\\", \\"oxidase\\", \\"NADPH oxidase\\", \\"metallothionein-II\\", \\"Bax\\", \\"p53\\", \\"Erk1/2\\", \\"Stat3\\", \\"Src\\", \\"EGFR\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Thus, in the present study, the roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) were examined in ursolic acid induced apoptosis in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Ursolic acid significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased the sub-G1 population and the number of ethidium homodimer and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive cells in HepG2 cells. Also, ursolic acid enhanced the cleavages of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase3, attenuated the expression of astrocyte elevated gene (AEG1) and survivin in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, ursolic acid increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and coenzyme A carboxylase and also enhanced phosphorylation of GSK3β at inactive form serine 9, whereas ursolic acid attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in HepG2 cells. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C or GSK3β inhibitor SB216763 blocked the cleavages of PARP and caspase 3 induced by ursolic acid in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, proteosomal inhibitor MG132 suppressed AMPK activation, GSK3β phosphorylation, cleaved PARP and deceased AEG-1 induced by ursolic acid in HepG2 cells. Overall, our findings suggest that ursolic acid induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells via AMPK activation and GSK3β phosphorylation as a potent chemopreventive agent.

The molecular events during nongenotoxic carcinogenesis and their temporal order are poorly understood but thought to include long-lasting perturbations of gene expression. Here, we have investigated the temporal sequence of molecular and pathological perturbations at early stages of phenobarbital (PB) mediated liver tumor promotion in vivo. Molecular profiling (mRNA, microRNA [miRNA], DNA methylation, and proteins) of mouse liver during 13 weeks of PB treatment revealed progressive increases in hepatic expression of long noncoding RNAs and miRNAs originating from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster, a locus that has recently been associated with stem cell pluripotency in mice and various neoplasms in humans. PB induction of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster noncoding RNA (ncRNA) Meg3 was localized to glutamine synthetase-positive hypertrophic perivenous hepatocytes, suggesting a role for β-catenin signaling in the dysregulation of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. The carcinogenic relevance of Dlk1-Dio3 locus ncRNA induction was further supported by in vivo genetic dependence on constitutive androstane receptor and β-catenin pathways. Our data identify Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs as novel candidate early biomarkers for mouse liver tumor promotion and provide new opportunities for assessing the carcinogenic potential of novel compounds.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"androstane\\", \\"glutamine\\", \\"phenobarbital\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVES: Nine different functional UGT1A enzymes are generated from a single UGT1A gene by alternative splicing, with each enzyme having a unique exon 1. SN-38, the active metabolite of the anticancer agent irinotecan, is metabolized by both UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. We aim to characterize the UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes in Asians and Caucasians and gain insights on their functional consequences. METHODS: Asian and Caucasian individuals were genotyped for UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 variants. RESULTS: A higher frequency of the UGT1A9 -118T10 allele was observed in Asians compared to Caucasians, while the -275T>A and -2152C>T variants were relatively uncommon in Caucasians and not found in Asians. The strongest linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between the UGT1A1 -53 and -3156 and between the UGT1A9 -275 and -2152 loci. Lower LD was observed between the -118 UGT1A9 variant and the UGT1A1 variants. Fourteen UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes were found in Asians, seven of them found to be shared by both populations. Common UGT1A9-UGT1A1 diplotypes were defined, and a difference was observed across the SN-38 glucuronidation rates in Caucasian livers stratified by diplotypes. CONCLUSION: This study for the first time described common UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes, highlighting important ethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians. If the functional effect of these haplotypes can be confirmed, this haplotypic information would be applicable to the correct design of prospective clinical studies of irinotecan, as well as of other drugs primarily metabolized by both UGT1A1 and UGT1A9.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"UGT1A\\", \\"UGT1A1\\", \\"UDP-glucuronosyltransferase1A9 and 1A1\\", \\"UGT1A9\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This regularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill the abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the accuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is important because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it. This paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the regularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie group. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the embedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE is the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector space, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of regularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task. We show that TorusE is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and is faster than the original TransE.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We deal with embedding a large scale knowledge graph composed of entities and relations into a continuous vector space. TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.[2]: Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.

Projection makes the model more flexible by choosing components of embeddings to represent each relation. TransR [2] has a matrix for each relation and the entities are mapped by linear transformation that multiplies the matrix to calculate the score of a triple. TransR is considered as generalized TransH because projection is one of linear transformations. These models have an advantage in power of expression comparing with TransE. At the same time, however, they easily become overfitted."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper. Please write an abstract for this paper.

Dendritic cells (DCs), which are antigen-presenting cells, have the unique ability to induce both innate and acquired immune responses and may significantly influence virus pathogenicity. To understand the interaction between IBDV and DCs, a microarray was used to analyse the response of DCs infected by IBDV. IBDV infection induced 479 upregulated and 466 downregulated mRNAs in chicken DCs. Analysis of Gene Ontology suggested that transcription from the RNA polymerase II promoter and the RNA biosynthetic process were enriched, and pathway analyses suggested that oxidative phosphorylation, as well as the T cell receptor and Interleukin-17 (IL-17) signalling pathways might be activated by IBDV infection. Moreover, microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) alterations in IBDV - infected chicken DCs were observed. A total of 18 significantly upregulated or downregulated miRNAs and 441 significantly upregulated or downregulated lncRNAs were identified in IBDV - stimulated DCs. We constructed 42 transcription factor (TF)- miRNA - mRNA interactions involving 1 TF, 3 miRNAs, and 42 mRNAs in IBDV - stimulated DCs. Finally, we predicted the target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs, and constructed lncRNA - mRNA regulatory networks. The results of this study suggest a mechanism to explain how IBDV infection triggers an effective immune response in chicken DCs.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"dendritic cell\\", \\"Dendritic cells\\", \\"genes\\", \\"DCs\\", \\"antigen-presenting cells\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"infection\\", \\"expressed\\", \\"pathway\\", \\"RNA biosynthetic process\\", \\"contagious\\", \\"upregulated\\", \\"infectious bursal disease\\", \\"acquired immune responses\\", \\"downregulated\\", \\"transcription from the RNA polymerase II promoter\\", \\"oxidative phosphorylation\\", \\"immune response\\", \\"signalling pathways\\", \\"regulatory networks\\", \\"immunosuppressive disease\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"lncRNAs\\", \\"lncRNA\\", \\"microRNA\\", \\"miRNAs\\", \\"T cell receptor\\", \\"mRNA\\", \\"miRNA\\", \\"TF\\", \\"Interleukin-17\\", \\"IL-17\\", \\"long non-coding RNA\\", \\"mRNAs\\", \\"transcription factor\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"Avian\\", \\"poultry\\", \\"chicken\\", \\"chickens\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"infected\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"Gene Ontology\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"Analysis\\", \\"study\\", \\"Genome-wide profiling\\", \\"analyse\\", \\"analyses\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": [\\"infectious bursal disease virus\\", \\"IBDV\\", \\"virus\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

BACKGROUND Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive . Previous studies suggest that less costly , pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard , continuous doses . Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis . OBJECTIVE Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis . METHODS We conducted a double-blind , randomized , noninferiority , clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center . The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25 % distal subungual clinical involvement . Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened ; 306 were randomized . Terbinafine , 250 mg daily for 3 months ( continuous ) or terbinafine , 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months ( pulse ) was administered . The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months . Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete ( clinical plus mycological ) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails . RESULTS Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for : mycological cure of the target toenail ( 70.9 % [ 105/148 ] vs 58.7 % [ 84/143 ] ; P =.03 , relative risk [ RR ] of 1.21 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.02-1.43 ] ) ; clinical cure of the target toenail ( 44.6 % [ 66/148 ] vs 29.3 % [ 42/143 ] ; P =.007 , RR =1.52 [ 95 % CI , 1.11-2.07 ) ; complete cure of the target toenail ( 40.5 % [ 60/148 ] vs 28.0 % [ 40/143 ] ; P =.02 , RR=1.45 [ 95 % CI , 1.04-2.01 ) ; and complete cure of all 10 toenails ( 25.2 % [ 36/143 ] vs 14.7 % [ 21/143 ] ; P =.03 , RR =1.71 [ 95 % CI , 1.05-2.79 ) . Tolerability of the regimens did not differ significantly between the groups ( chi2 =1.63 ; P =.65 ) . LIMITATIONS The study population primarily consisted of older men with severe onychomycosis . CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the superiority of continuous- over pulse-dose terbinafine . We also found this expensive therapy to be much less effective than previously believed , particularly for achieving complete cure of all 10 toenails .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"antifungal medications\\", \\"continuous-dose terbinafine\\", \\"continuous terbinafine\\", \\"terbinafine\\", \\"Pulse\\", \\"standard continuous-dose terbinafine\\", \\"pulse-dose terbinafine\\", \\"Terbinafine\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"Tolerability\\", \\"of the target toenail at 18 months\\", \\"mycological cure\\", \\"complete cure\\", \\"clinical cure and complete ( clinical plus mycological ) cure of the target toenail\\", \\"complete cure of all 10 toenails\\", \\"clinical cure\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"306\\", \\"onychomycosis\\", \\"men\\", \\"severe onychomycosis\\", \\"positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25 % distal subungual clinical involvement\\", \\"of older\\", \\"Six hundred eighteen\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Deficiency of Kir2.1 channels results in elevated blood pressure and increased vascular resistance. Flow - induced vasodilatation in human resistance arteries is also regulated by inwardly rectifying K(+) channels. This study presents the first direct evidence that Kir channels play a critical role in physiological endothelial responses to flow. Inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels are known to be sensitive to flow, but their role in flow - induced endothelial responses is not known. The goal of this study is to establish the role of Kir channels in flow - induced vasodilatation and to provide first insights into the mechanisms responsible for Kir signalling in this process. First, we establish that primary endothelial cells isolated from murine mesenteric arteries express functional Kir2.1 channels sensitive to shear stress. Then, using the Kir2.1(+/-) heterozygous mouse model, we establish that downregulation of Kir2.1 results in significant decrease in shear - activated Kir currents and inhibition of endothelium -dependent flow - induced vasodilatation (FIV) assayed in pressurized mesenteric arteries pre-constricted with endothelin-1. Deficiency in Kir2.1 also results in the loss of flow - induced phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt, as well as inhibition of NO generation. All the effects are fully rescued by endothelial cell (EC)-specific overexpression of Kir2.1. A component of FIV that is Kir independent is abrogated by blocking Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channels. Kir2.1 has no effect on endothelium -independent and K(+) - induced vasodilatation in denuded arteries. Kir2.1(+/-) mice also show increased mean blood pressure measured by carotid artery cannulation and increased microvascular resistance measured using a tail-cuff. Importantly, blocking Kir channels also inhibits flow - induced vasodilatation in human subcutaneous adipose microvessels. Endothelial Kir channels contribute to FIV of mouse mesenteric arteries via an NO -dependent mechanism, whereas Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channels mediate FIV via an NO -independent pathway. Kir2 channels also regulate vascular resistance and blood pressure. Finally, Kir channels also contribute to FIV in human subcutaneous microvessels.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"pressurized mesenteric arteries\\", \\"endothelial cells\\", \\"endothelial cell\\", \\"EC\\", \\"carotid artery\\", \\"endothelial\\", \\"microvessels\\", \\"denuded arteries\\", \\"mesenteric arteries\\", \\"arteries\\", \\"Endothelial\\", \\"endothelium\\", \\"Kir2.1(+/-)\\", \\"mesenteric resistance arteries\\", \\"adipose\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"blood pressure\\", \\"downregulation\\", \\"regulated\\", \\"regulate\\", \\"Flow\\", \\"pathway\\", \\"responses\\", \\"signalling\\", \\"overexpression\\", \\"flow\\", \\"mouse model\\", \\"phosphorylation\\", \\"vascular resistance\\", \\"FIV\\", \\"vasodilatation\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"eNOS\\", \\"Kir\\", \\"Kir2.1\\", \\"Inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels\\", \\"Kir2.1 channels\\", \\"Kir channels\\", \\"Inwardly rectifying K(+) channels\\", \\"K(+)\\", \\"Kir2 channels\\", \\"Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channels\\", \\"Akt\\", \\"endothelin-1\\", \\"inwardly rectifying K(+) channels\\", \\"nitric oxide\\", \\"inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir2.1) channels\\", \\"NO\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"mouse\\", \\"mice\\", \\"human\\", \\"murine\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"increased vascular resistance\\", \\"elevated blood pressure\\", \\"increased mean blood pressure\\", \\"increased microvascular resistance\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"cannulation\\", \\"tail-cuff\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"subcutaneous\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Concomitant use of SPRYCEL and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with SPRYCEL, close monitoring for toxicity and a SPRYCEL dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided. Drugs that may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers: Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations. In patients in whom CYP3A4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital) are indicated, alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be used. If SPRYCEL must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer, a dose increase in SPRYCEL should be considered. St. Johns wort (Hypericum perforatum) may decrease SPRYCEL plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving SPRYCEL should not take St. Johns wort. Antacids: Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent. Simultaneous administration of SPRYCEL with antacids should be avoided. If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of SPRYCEL. H2 Blockers/Proton Pump Inhibitors: Long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors (eg, famotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. The concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors with SPRYCEL is not recommended. The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving SPRYCEL therapy. Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by dasatinib CYP3A4 Substrates: Dasatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving SPRYCEL. Hepatic Impairment There are currently no clinical studies with SPRYCEL in patients with impaired liver function (clinical studies have excluded patients with ALT and/or AST  2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range and/or total bilirubin  2 times the upper limit of the normal range). Metabolism of dasatinib is mainly hepatic. Caution is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment There are currently no clinical studies with SPRYCEL in patients with impaired renal function (clinical studies have excluded patients with serum creatinine concentration  1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range). Dasatinib and its metabolites are minimally excreted via the kidney. Since the renal excretion of unchanged dasatinib and its metabolites is  4%, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal insufficiency.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"SPRYCEL\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"phenobarbital\\", \\"alfentanil\\", \\"astemizole\\", \\"ergotamine\\", \\"ketoconazole\\", \\"erythromycin\\", \\"carbamazepine\\", \\"saquinavir\\", \\"telithromycin\\", \\"cisapride\\", \\"ritonavir\\", \\"atazanavir\\", \\"omeprazole\\", \\"dasatinib\\", \\"phenytoin\\", \\"tacrolimus\\", \\"cyclosporine\\", \\"dihydroergotamine\\", \\"fentanyl\\", \\"famotidine\\", \\"Dasatinib\\", \\"nefazodone\\", \\"dexamethasone\\", \\"itraconazole\\", \\"quinidine\\", \\"indinavir\\", \\"pimozide\\", \\"sirolimus\\", \\"terfenadine\\", \\"rifampicin\\", \\"clarithromycin\\", \\"nelfinavir\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"H2 Blockers\\", \\"Antacids\\", \\"antacid\\", \\"antacids\\", \\"Proton Pump Inhibitors\\", \\"H2 blockers\\", \\"ergot alkaloids\\", \\"proton pump inhibitors\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the EEG criteria proposed by a panel of experts at the fourth London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus in Salzburg, 2013 (henceforth called the Salzburg criteria).Two raters blinded to all other patient data retrospectively analysed the EEG recordings and, using the Salzburg criteria, categorised patients as in NCSE or not in NCSE.INTERPRETATION: The Salzburg criteria for diagnosis of NCSE have high diagnostic accuracy and excellent inter-rater agreement, making them suitable for implementation in clinical practice.Salzburg Consensus Criteria for Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus--approach to clinical application.BACKGROUND: Salzburg Consensus Criteria for diagnosis of Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (SCNC) were proposed at the 4th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on status epilepticus in Salzburg (2013).The Salzburg Consensus Criteria for NCSE [1] have been modified according to the Standardized Terminology of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society [2] and validated in three different cohorts, with a sensitivity of 97.2%, a specificity of 95.9%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 96.3% in patients with clinical signs of NCSE.Two raters blinded to all other patient data retrospectively analysed the EEG recordings and, using the Salzburg criteria, categorised patients as in NCSE or not in NCSE.Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus: Validating the Salzburg Criteria Against an Expert EEG Examiner.INTERPRETATION  The Salzburg criteria for diagnosis of NCSE have high diagnostic accuracy and excellent inter-rater agreement, making them suitable for implementation in clinical practice.Clinical presentations and the Salzburg EEG criteria for NCSE were used to identify patients with NCSE after CSE.The difficulty of diagnosing NCSE in clinical practice; external validation of the Salzburg criteria.To improve the diagnostic accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG) criteria for nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), external validation of the recently proposed Salzburg criteria is paramount.Clinical presentations and the Salzburg EEG criteria for NCSE were used to identify patients with NCSE after CSE.We divided the patients into those who were finally with diagnosed NCSE (NCSE-p) and those who were not (non-NCSE) according to the Salzburg Diagnostic EEG criteria.We performed an external, retrospective, diagnostic accuracy study of the Salzburg criteria, using EEG recordings from patients with and without a clinical suspicion of having NCSE.BACKGROUND Salzburg Consensus Criteria for diagnosis of Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (SCNC) were proposed at the 4th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on status epilepticus in Salzburg (2013).To improve the diagnostic accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG) criteria for nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), external validation of the recently proposed Salzburg criteria is paramount.We performed an external, retrospective, diagnostic accuracy study of the Salzburg criteria, using EEG recordings from patients with and without a clinical suspicion of having NCSE.INTERPRETATION: The Salzburg criteria for diagnosis of NCSE have high diagnostic accuracy and excellent inter-rater agreement, making them suitable for implementation in clinical practice.We divided the patients into those who were finally with diagnosed NCSE (NCSE-p) and those who were not (non-NCSE) according to the Salzburg Diagnostic EEG criteria.Two raters blinded to all other patient data retrospectively analysed the EEG recordings and, using the Salzburg criteria, categorised patients as in NCSE or not in NCSE.","answer":"Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Initially, the preparation of thiophene oligomers and study of their reduced and oxidized forms provided models for the doped portions of polythiophene. 1 One of the rst small molecules to exhibit ambipolar character in an OFET was based on a terthienoquinoidal core (1). 2 Thorough understanding of the stability of the reduced and oxidized states of 1 led to increased OFET performance and the discovery of ambipolar transport characteristics. 3 Otsubo, Aso and coworkers accomplished the synthesis of the largest family of QOTs (2). 4 Solubility issues of the larger QOTs were solved by fusion of a solubilizing bis(butoxymethyl)cyclopentane unit to the thiophene core. The longest members (n ¼ 5, 6) featured open-shell ground states and low-energy absorptions to 1400 nm. 5 A terthiophene derivative of 2 as the active layer in OFETs was also described. 6 Recently, Zhu et al. reported nchannel behaviour in thin lms of QTA 3. 7 As noted by the authors, isomerization issues inherent in QOTs are eliminated by moving to the fused QTA core. Lastly, the QTA scaffolds are promising for nonlinear optics due to their rigidity and symmetry. 8 Large alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons possessing low energy triplet excited states and multiphoton absorption properties are of interest for singlet exciton ssion. 9 Our group has initiated studies on a seldom explored class of quinoidal molecules based on the indenouorene skeleton. 10 While most of our work has focused on indeno [1,2-b]uorenes, 11 we have reported derivatives of indeno[2,1-c]uorene 4 12 and uoreno[4,3-c]uorene 5 (Fig. 2), 13 which exhibit interesting absorption proles and amphoteric redox behaviour. Very recently we reported the fully conjugated indacenedithiophenes, 14 where thiophenes replaced the outer benzene rings of indeno [1,2-b]uorenes. In analogy, exchange of the bridging sp 2 carbon units in 4 and 5 with isoelectronic sulfur atoms to provide 6 and 7 is an attractive and straightforward approach to further tune the quinoidal core of indenouorenes. Sulfur incorporation into the framework of polycyclic hydrocarbons is a versatile method to promote good solid-state ordering and improve stability at ambient conditions. 15 Herein we describe the synthesis and characterization of a series of quinoidal diindeno(thieno)thiophenes (DI[n]Ts) (Fig. 3). This work represents a new approach to quinoidal thienoacenes through the fusion of electron-accepting indene fragments to a thienoacene core. The ease of thiophene synthesis and anticipated stability of the nal quinoidal molecules are appealing features of this strategy. Possible substituents include (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl groups to favour solid-state order 16 and aryl groups to tune the electronics 11b,c of the architecture.</p>Results and discussion<p>Synthesis is initiated by Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of 3,4dibromothiophene and commercially available 2-ethoxy-carbonylbenzeneboronic acid (Scheme 1). Use of Buchwald's SPhos ligand was critical for efficient coupling of the electron-rich bromothiophene with the electron-poor arylboronic acid. 17 Next, saponication of diester 8 followed by formation of the acid chloride and Friedel-Cras acylation provides dione 9 in good yield. Gratifyingly, we found that 3,4-dibromothiophene could be mono-acylated to give 10 in 92% yield. Condensation with ethyl thioglycolate in the presence of potassium carbonate furnishes thienothiophene 11 in 80% yield. This route avoids the preparation of unsubstituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene either through traditional methods 18 or the improved Matzger route. 19 Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling gives diester 12 in quantitative yield. Elaboration to 13 proceeds in 79% yield over four steps.</p><p>Dione 15 was prepared in an analogous manner via diester 14 starting from 3,5-dibromodithieno[3,2-b:2 0 ,3 0 -d]thiophene. Notably, the synthesis of diones 9, 13 and 15 can be performed on multi-gram scale with no silica gel chromatography (see ESI ‡ for full details). Nucleophilic addition of (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl lithium proceeds quantitatively despite poor solubility of the dione starting materials. Reduction of the respective diols by anhydrous SnCl 2 in toluene gives the quinoidal DI[n]Ts in modest to very good yield. Interestingly, the reduction to DI3T is complete within minutes while the reduction to DI1T and DI2T requires several hours to reach full conversion. The nal compounds were stable toward silica gel and ambient conditions. No measures to protect the compounds from air or water were taken and no signicant decomposition was observed in solution or in the solid-state.</p><p>Single crystals of DI[n]Ts sufficient for characterization by Xray diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation from CH 2 Cl 2 . DI1T-TIPSE arranges into a pairwise slipped stacks with distances between average planes of 3.30 Å within the pair and 3.37 Å between adjacent pairs (Fig. 4, le). Lateral (short-axis) slip of the core was found to be 1.06 Å in the pair and 5.82 Å between pairs. DI1T-TESE also packs in pairwise slipped stacks with the distance between average planes of the molecules of 3.43 Å in the pair and 3.34 Å between pairs (Fig. 4, right). The smaller trialkylsilyl group altered the lateral slip to 2.52 Å in the pair and 2.55 Å between pairs. DI2T forms an alternating 1D structure rather than the dimers seen with DI1T due to its centrosymmetry (Fig. 5, top). The distance between the average planes is 3.41 Å with a lateral slip of 1.46 Å between cores of the molecules. Spacing between neighbouring 1D stacks was greater than van der Waals distance. DI3T shows strong overlapping of the quinoidal cores with inter-planar distance of 3.46 Å and lateral slip of 1.79 Å and 1.23 Å (Fig. 5, bottom). The 1D columns are essentially insulated from adjacent columns by the (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl groups. Table 1 summarizes the bond distances in the core of the DI[n]T family. 20 All three show distinct bond alternation with the double bonds averaging 1.36-1.37 Å and single bonds 1.44-1.45 Å, fully supporting the proposed quinoidal structures. These values are also in good agreement with those observed in their purely hydrocarbon analogues. 12,13 The peripheral benzene rings in the DI[n]Ts have an average bond distance of 1.390 Å with a standard deviation of 0.006 Å. The molecules are essentially planar, as the root-mean-square (RMS) deviation from the average molecular plane is negligible; DI1T-TIPSE showed the greatest RMS deviation of only 0.042 Å. 21 In addition to the DI[n]Ts, we were able to obtain single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction of diones 9 and 13 from CHCl 3 /cyclohexane and upon slow cooling from reuxing nitrobenzene, respectively (Fig. 6). 22 Dione 9 alternates its orientation within the 1D stack such that the molecular  arrangement would result in a net dipole; however, the dipole of the neighbouring stack balances the opposing dipole (see Fig. S4 ‡). Dione 13 shows a more ordered 1D arrangement due to its centrosymmetry. The distance between the average planes of 9 and 13 are essentially identical at 3.39 Å and 3.38 Å, respectively. Dione 9 has a signicant RMS deviation from planarity of 0.079 Å while 13 is nearly planar at 0.027 Å. This is likely due to the steric crowding of the hydrogens in the bay region of 9. Interestingly, the carbonyl oxygens of 9 and 13 show a strong interaction with the bay carbons of adjacent stacks with distances of 3.25 Å for 9 and 3.28 Å for 13.</p><p>The deeply colored DI[n]Ts were characterized further by absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 7). All compounds exhibit strong, acene-like vibronic features from 350-600 nm and low energy absorptions reaching into the NIR (800-925 nm). The absorption edges are staggered, possibly as a result of the family's alternating axo-/centro-symmetry. Interestingly, DI1T and DI2T exhibit similar absorbance proles to the related indeno[2,1-c]-  2). DI1T shows a reversible oxidation while the oxidation of DI2T   and DI3T are essentially irreversible. The difference between E 1 red and E 2 red decreases by ca. 0.1 V upon sequential expansion of the quinoidal core. This is most likely due to the mitigation of Coulombic repulsion in the doubly reduced species. 24 The values for E ox appear to approach a constant, indicating that incorporation of additional thiophene units does not alter the ionization potential to a large degree. LUMO and HOMO energy levels were derived from the E 1 red and E ox values, respectively. E gap decreases over the series in nonlinear fashion.</p><p>The DI[n]T anion radicals were obtained by reduction of the neutral species with K metal in THF. The EPR spectrum of a blue solution of DI1Tc À is shown in Fig. 9; see ESI for the EPR spectra of DI2Tc À (Fig. S8 ‡) and DI3Tc À (Fig. S9 ‡). The hyperne coupling constants (HFCCs) of the spin active nuclei were determined and experimental carbon spin densities (r c ) were calculated by the McConnell equation (Tables 3 and S1 ‡). Due to the lack of spin active nuclei on the core of DI[n]T, r c could not be directly calculated. Very little spin density is contained within the fused benzene rings     (0.004-0.044), with more contained in the ethynyl group (0.094-0.112). The approximate spin densities remaining in the core for DI1T, DI2T, and DI3T are 0.59, 0.64, and 0.66, respectively, indicating that a majority of the spin density resides in the thienoacene unit. DFT calculations were performed to predict the geometry of the neutral, radical anion and dianion states of the DI[n]Ts. For computational ease, trimethylsilyl was used in place of the larger TIPS/TES groups. Bond distances in the core of DI2T are shown in Fig. 10 and Table S3; ‡ see ESI for calculated geometries of DI1T (Fig. S10 and Table S2 ‡) and DI3T (Fig. S12 and Table S4 ‡). The calculations replicate the quinoidal character of the neutral DI[n]Ts but overestimate the degree of bond alternation in DI2T and DI3T by as much as 0.02 Å compared to the solid state data (Table 1). Upon one electron reduction, the quinoidal bonds begin to homogenize as the unpaired electron is delocalized over the system. The dianion shows a reversal of the quinoidal pattern and thus the expected rearomatization of the central thiophenes. 25 In accord with the CV experiments, the dianionic, fully aromatic species is stabilized with respect to the neutral state.</p>Conclusions<p>In summary, the synthesis and characterization of a new class of quinoidal thienoacenes has been reported. The synthetic route is shown to be rapid and amenable to scale. X-ray crystallography corroborates the presence of distinct quinoidal motifs and reveals that the title compounds pack in progressively closer pairwise 1D arrangements. Analysis of the reduced states by EPR spectra and DFT calculations indicate stable anionic species. The large degree of p-orbital overlap, NIR absorption and favourable electrochemical properties suggest great potential for application in organic electronics. Future work will consist of further derivatization and expansion of the DI[n]T structures as well as testing their performance as organic semiconductors.</p>","answer":"We report the preparation and characterization of a new class of quinoidal thienoacenes. The synthetic route is efficient, high-yielding and scalable with the potential for further functionalization. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that, as size increases, the molecules pack in progressively closer 1D arrangements. The title compounds are shown to have amphoteric redox behaviour by cyclic voltammetry. The anion radicals are studied by EPR spectrometry and by computations. The electronaccepting nature, NIR absorption and the low-lying LUMO energies (ca. À4.0 eV) allude to potential use in materials applications."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

We gather and annotate a large scale dataset from Twitter, MMHS150K, and propose different models that jointly analyze textual and visual information for hate speech detection, comparing them with unimodal detection. We provide quantitative and qualitative results and analyze the challenges of the proposed task. We find that, even though images are useful for the hate speech detection task, current multimodal models cannot outperform models analyzing only text. We discuss why and open the field and the dataset for further research.Related Work ::: Hate Speech DetectionThe literature on detecting hate speech on online textual publications is extensive. Schmidt and Wiegand BIBREF1 recently provided a good survey of it, where they review the terminology used over time, the features used, the existing datasets and the different approaches. However, the field lacks a consistent dataset and evaluation protocol to compare proposed methods. Saleem et al. BIBREF2 compare different classification methods detecting hate speech in Reddit and other forums. Wassem and Hovy BIBREF3 worked on hate speech detection on twitter, published a manually annotated dataset and studied its hate distribution. Later Wassem BIBREF4 extended the previous published dataset and compared amateur and expert annotations, concluding that amateur annotators are more likely than expert annotators to label items as hate speech. Park and Fung BIBREF5 worked on Wassem datasets and proposed a classification method using a CNN over Word2Vec BIBREF6 word embeddings, showing also classification results on racism and sexism hate sub-classes. Davidson et al. BIBREF7 also worked on hate speech detection on twitter, publishing another manually annotated dataset. They test different classifiers such as SVMs and decision trees and provide a performance comparison. Malmasi and Zampieri BIBREF8 worked on Davidson's dataset improving his results using more elaborated features. ElSherief et al. BIBREF9 studied hate speech on twitter and selected the most frequent terms in hate tweets based on Hatebase, a hate expression repository. They propose a big hate dataset but it lacks manual annotations, and all the tweets containing certain hate expressions are considered hate speech. Zhang et al. BIBREF10 recently proposed a more sophisticated approach for hate speech detection, using a CNN and a GRU BIBREF11 over Word2Vec BIBREF6 word embeddings. They show experiments in different datasets outperforming previous methods. Next, we summarize existing hate speech datasets:[noitemsep,leftmargin=*]RM BIBREF10: Formed by 2,435 tweets discussing Refugees and Muslims, annotated as hate or non-hate.DT BIBREF7: Formed by 24,783 tweets annotated as hate, offensive language or neither. In our work, offensive language tweets are considered as non-hate.WZ-LS BIBREF5: A combination of Wassem datasets BIBREF4, BIBREF3 labeled as racism, sexism, neither or both that make a total of 18,624 tweets.Semi-Supervised BIBREF9: Contains 27,330 general hate speech Twitter tweets crawled in a semi-supervised manner.Although often modern social media publications include images, not too many contributions exist that exploit visual information. Zhong et al. BIBREF12 worked on classifying Instagram images as potential cyberbullying targets, exploiting both the image content, the image caption and the comments. However, their visual information processing is limited to the use of features extracted by a pre-trained CNN, the use of which does not achieve any improvement. Hosseinmardi et al. BIBREF13 also address the problem of detecting cyberbullying incidents on Instagram exploiting both textual and image content. But, again, their visual information processing is limited to use the features of a pre-trained CNN, and the improvement when using visual features on cyberbullying classification is only of 0.01%.The MMHS150K dataset ::: Tweets GatheringWe used the Twitter API to gather real-time tweets from September 2018 until February 2019, selecting the ones containing any of the 51 Hatebase terms that are more common in hate speech tweets, as studied in BIBREF9. We filtered out retweets, tweets containing less than three words and tweets containing porn related terms. From that selection, we kept the ones that included images and downloaded them. Twitter applies hate speech filters and other kinds of content control based on its policy, although the supervision is based on users' reports. Therefore, as we are gathering tweets from real-time posting, the content we get has not yet passed any filter.The MMHS150K dataset ::: Textual Image FilteringWe aim to create a multimodal hate speech database where all the instances contain visual and textual information that we can later process to determine if a tweet is hate speech or not. But a considerable amount of the images of the selected tweets contain only textual information, such as screenshots of other tweets. To ensure that all the dataset instances contain both visual and textual information, we remove those tweets. To do that, we use TextFCN BIBREF22, BIBREF23 , a Fully Convolutional Network that produces a pixel wise text probability map of an image. We set empirical thresholds to discard images that have a substantial total text probability, filtering out 23% of the collected tweets.Methodology ::: Unimodal Treatment ::: Images.All images are resized such that their shortest size has 500 pixels. During training, online data augmentation is applied as random cropping of 299times 299 patches and mirroring. We use a CNN as the image features extractor which is an Imagenet BIBREF24 pre-trained Google Inception v3 architecture BIBREF25. The fine-tuning process of the Inception v3 layers aims to modify its weights to extract the features that, combined with the textual information, are optimal for hate speech detection.Methodology ::: Unimodal Treatment ::: Tweet Text.We train a single layer LSTM with a 150-dimensional hidden state for hate / not hate classification. The input dimensionality is set to 100 and GloVe BIBREF26 embeddings are used as word input representations. Since our dataset is not big enough to train a GloVe word embedding model, we used a pre-trained model that has been trained in two billion tweets. This ensures that the model will be able to produce word embeddings for slang and other words typically used in Twitter. To process the tweets text before generating the word embeddings, we use the same pipeline as the model authors, which includes generating symbols to encode Twitter special interactions such as user mentions (@user) or hashtags (#hashtag). To encode the tweet text and input it later to multimodal models, we use the LSTM hidden state after processing the last tweet word. Since the LSTM has been trained for hate speech classification, it extracts the most useful information for this task from the text, which is encoded in the hidden state after inputting the last tweet word.Methodology ::: Multimodal ArchitecturesThe objective of this work is to build a hate speech detector that leverages both textual and visual data and detects hate speech publications based on the context given by both data modalities. To study how the multimodal context can boost the performance compared to an unimodal context we evaluate different models: a Feature Concatenation Model (FCM), a Spatial Concatenation Model (SCM) and a Textual Kernels Model (TKM). All of them are CNN+RNN models with three inputs: the tweet image, the tweet text and the text appearing in the image (if any).Methodology ::: Multimodal Architectures ::: Feature Concatenation Model (FCM)The image is fed to the Inception v3 architecture and the 2048 dimensional feature vector after the last average pooling layer is used as the visual representation. This vector is then concatenated with the 150 dimension vectors of the LSTM last word hidden states of the image text and the tweet text, resulting in a 2348 feature vector. This vector is then processed by three fully connected layers of decreasing dimensionality (2348, 1024, 512) with following corresponding batch normalization and ReLu layers until the dimensions are reduced to two, the number of classes, in the last classification layer. The FCM architecture is illustrated in Fig. FIGREF26.Methodology ::: Multimodal Architectures ::: Spatial Concatenation Model (SCM)Instead of using the latest feature vector before classification of the Inception v3 as the visual representation, in the SCM we use the 8times 8times 2048 feature map after the last Inception module. Then we concatenate the 150 dimension vectors encoding the tweet text and the tweet image text at each spatial location of that feature map. The resulting multimodal feature map is processed by two Inception-E blocks BIBREF28. After that, dropout and average pooling are applied and, as in the FCM model, three fully connected layers are used to reduce the dimensionality until the classification layer.ResultsTable TABREF31 shows the F-score, the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and the mean accuracy (ACC) of the proposed models when different inputs are available. TT refers to the tweet text, IT to the image text and I to the image. It also shows results for the LSTM, for the Davison method proposed in BIBREF7 trained with MMHS150K, and for random scores. Fig. FIGREF32 shows the Precision vs Recall plot and the ROC curve (which plots the True Positive Rate vs the False Positive Rate) of the different models.First, notice that given the subjectivity of the task and the discrepancies between annotators, getting optimal scores in the evaluation metrics is virtually impossible. However, a system with relatively low metric scores can still be very useful for hate speech detection in a real application: it will fire on publications for which most annotators agree they are hate, which are often the stronger attacks. The proposed LSTM to detect hate speech when only text is available, gets similar results as the method presented in BIBREF7, which we trained with MMHS150K and the same splits. However, more than substantially advancing the state of the art on hate speech detection in textual publications, our key purpose in this work is to introduce and work on its detection on multimodal publications. We use LSTM because it provides a strong representation of the tweet texts.The FCM trained only with images gets decent results, considering that in many publications the images might not give any useful information for the task. Fig. FIGREF33 shows some representative examples of the top hate and not hate scored images of this model. Many hate tweets are accompanied by demeaning nudity images, being sexist or homophobic. Other racist tweets are accompanied by images caricaturing black people. Finally, MEMES are also typically used in hate speech publications. The top scored images for not hate are portraits of people belonging to minorities. This is due to the use of slur inside these communities without an offensive intention, such as the word nigga inside the afro-american community or the word dyke inside the lesbian community. These results show that images can be effectively used to discriminate between offensive and non-offensive uses of those words.Despite the model trained only with images proves that they are useful for hate speech detection, the proposed multimodal models are not able to improve the detection compared to the textual models. Besides the different architectures, we have tried different training strategies, such as initializing the CNN weights with a model already trained solely with MMHS150K images or using dropout to force the multimodal models to use the visual information. Eventually, though, these models end up using almost only the text input for the prediction and producing very similar results to those of the textual models. The proposed multimodal models, such as TKM, have shown good performance in other tasks, such as VQA. Next, we analyze why they do not perform well in this task and with this data:[noitemsep,leftmargin=*]Noisy data. A major challenge of this task is the discrepancy between annotations due to subjective judgement. Although this affects also detection using only text, its repercussion is bigger in more complex tasks, such as detection using images or multimodal detection.Complexity and diversity of multimodal relations. Hate speech multimodal publications employ a lot of background knowledge which makes the relations between visual and textual elements they use very complex and diverse, and therefore difficult to learn by a neural network.Small set of multimodal examples. Fig. FIGREF5 shows some of the challenging multimodal hate examples that we aimed to detect. But although we have collected a big dataset of 150K tweets, the subset of multimodal hate there is still too small to learn the complex multimodal relations needed to identify multimodal hate.ConclusionsIn this work we have explored the task of hate speech detection on multimodal publications. We have created MMHS150K, to our knowledge the biggest available hate speech dataset, and the first one composed of multimodal data, namely tweets formed by image and text. We have trained different textual, visual and multimodal models with that data, and found out that, despite the fact that images are useful for hate speech detection, the multimodal models do not outperform the textual models. Finally, we have analyzed the challenges of the proposed task and dataset. Given that most of the content in Social Media nowadays is multimodal, we truly believe on the importance of pushing forward this research. The code used in this work is available in .Figure 1.

Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: [112] However, the proportion of deaths among those infected with MERS-CoV is much higher than that known for the HCoVs NL63, HKU1, 229E or OC43 in other countries, and even above that for SARS-CoV ; it is not a virus that could reasonably be described as a \\"storm in a teacup\\". It is the low transmission rate that has prevented worldwide spread, despite many \\"opportunities\\". Very early in the MERS outbreak, some animals were highly regarded as either the reservoir or intermediate host(s) of MERS-CoV with three of the first five cases having contact with DCs [73, 113, 114] . Today, animal MERS-CoV infections must be reported to the world organization for animal health as an emerging disease [115] . A summary of the first MERS cases reported by the WHO defined animal contact with humans as being direct and within 10 days prior to symptom onset [20] . This definition made no specific allowance for acquisition from DCs through a droplet-based route, which is very likely route for acquisition of a virus that initially and predominantly causes respiratory disease [23] . Camels are known to produce high levels of MERS-CoV RNA in their URT and lungs [116] . Providing support for a droplet transmission route and perhaps indicating the presence of RNA in smaller, drier droplet nuclei, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in a high volume air sample collected from a barn housing an infected DC [117] . The precise source from which humans acquire MERS-CoV remains poorly studied but it seems likely that animal and human behavioural factors may play roles (Fig. 3) [118] . These factors may prove important for human cases who do not describe any DC contact [119] nor any contact with a confirmed case. Whether the WHO definition of animal contact is sufficient to identify exposure to this respiratory virus remains unclear. Wording focuses on consumption of DC products but does not specifically ascribe risk to a droplet route for acquisition of MERS-CoV from DC [120] . Some MERS patients are listed in WHO disease notices as being in proximity to DCs or farms, but the individuals have not described coming into contact with the animals. No alternative path for acquiring infection is reported in many of these instances. What constitutes a definition of \\"contact\\" during these interviews has been defined for one study [72] . Despite this lack of clarity, the WHO consider that evidence linking MERS-CoV transmission between DCs to humans is irrefutable (Fig. 4) [120] . The possibility that bats were an animal host of MERS-CoV was initially widely discussed because of the existing diversity of coronaviruses known to reside among them [121] [122] [123] [124] . Conclusive evidence supporting bats as a source for human infections by MERS-CoV has yet to be found, but bats do appear to host ancestral representatives [53, 125] . However, these are not variants of the same virus nor always within the same phylogenetic lineage as MERS-CoV; they are each a genetically distinct virus. Bat-to-human infection by MERS-CoV is a purely speculative event. The only piece of MERS-CoV-specific evidence pointing to bats originates from amplification of a 190 nt fragment of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase gene of the MERS-CoV genome, identified in a faecal pellet from an insectivorous Emballonuridae bat, Taphozous perforatus found in Bisha, the KSA [121] . While very short, the sequence of the fragment defined it as a diagnostic discovery. Subsequently a link to DCs was reported [85] and that link has matured into a verified association [38, 126] (Fig. 4) . (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 3 Monthly detections of MERS-CoV (blue bars) and of cases who died (red bars) with some dates of interest marked for 2012 to 4 th September 2015. An approximation of when DC calving season [128] and when recently born DCs are weaned is indicated. Spring (green) and summer (orange) in the Arabian Peninsula are also shaded. Note the left-hand y-axis scale for 2014 and 2015 which is greater than for 2012/13. Sources of these public data include the WHO, Ministries of Health and FluTrackers [207] [208] [209] . Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal blog [210] . Modified and reprinted from Mackay IM, Arden KE. Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd. Virus Res 2015 Vol 202:60-88 with permission from Elsevier [5] DCs, which make up 95 % of all camels, have a central presence in the Arabian Peninsula where human-DC contact ranges from little to close [119] . Contact may be commonplace and could occur in variety of ways (Fig. 4a) . There are several large well-attended festivals, races, sales and parades which feature DCs and DCs are also kept and bred close to populated areas in the KSA [127, 128] . DC milk and meat are widely consumed and the older DC is an animal of ritual significance after the Hajj pilgrimage [129] . However, MERS-CoV infection frequency is reportedly much lower than is the widespread and frequent habit of eating, drinking and preparing DC products. Daily ingestion of fresh unpasteurized DC milk is common among the desert Bedouin and many others in the KSA. DC urine is also consumed or used for supposed health benefits. Despite camel butchery being a local occupation, neither butchers nor other at-risk groups are identifiable among MERS cases; this may simply be a reporting issue rather than an unexplainable absence of MERS. A small case-control study published in 2015 identified direct DC contact, and not ingestion of products, to be associated with onset of MERS [38] . The first sero-survey of livestock living in the Middle East region was conducted during 2012-2013 [85] . DCs were sampled from a mostly Canary Island-born herd and from Omani DCs (originally imported from the Horn of Africa) [85] . A neutralising antibody assay found only 10 % of strongly seropositive Canary Island [5] . b Camel-to-human infections appear to be infrequent, while human-to-human spread of infection is regularly facilitated by poor IPC in healthcare settings where transmission is amplified, accounting for the bulk of cases. There are human MERS cases that do not fall into either category of source and it is unclear if these acquired infection through some entirely separate route, or from cases that escaped diagnosis. c Hypothetical ways in which subclinical (when infection may not meet a previously defined clinical threshold of signs and/or symptoms) or asymptomatic (no obvious signs or measured, noticed or recalled symptoms of illness) MERS-CoV infection may be implicated in transmission DC sera could neutralise MERS-CoV while all Omani DC sera had high levels of specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody [85] . This indicated that DCs had in the past been infected by MERS-CoV, or a very similar virus. Since this study, a host of peer-reviewed reports have looked at both DCs and other animals, and the possibility that they may host MERS-CoV infection. Seropositive DCs have been found throughout the Arabian Peninsula including Oman, the KSA, Qatar, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait as well as Sudan, Somalia, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia in Africa and the Canary Islands [85, [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] . Other animals tested include sheep, cows, pigs, horses, donkeys, mules, birds, water buffalo, goats, Bactrian camels, llamas and guanaco (south American camelids) but none had detectable neutralising antibody against MERS-CoV [4, 74, 78, 85, 86, 135, 136] . No virology or serology studies of human samples from areas in Africa where there are camels with a history of MERS-CoV have been reported to date. However,an absence of unexplained pneumonia that may be attributable to MERS-CoV infection may not signal the absence of virus among humans in each country but simply reflect a lack of expensive epidemiology studies conducted by resource-poor countries. It is thus unclear whether MERS-CoV, or an antigenically related CoV, is an unrecognized pathogen in these regions, perhaps circulating for even longer than it has been known in the Arabian Peninsula [133] . MERS-CoV RNA has also been detected in DC samples, and recovery of infectious virus has also been achieved from DC samples [4, 77, 117, 132, [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] . From some of these, full or majority length genomes of MERS-CoV have been sequenced [77, 137, 138] . DC versions of MERS-CoV were found to be as similar to each other, as were variants detected from different humans over time and across distance. Antibody screening assays have also detected crossreactive antibodies in sera. These were identified as such by screening sera against similar viruses, for example BCoV or HCoV-OC43 (as an antigenic facsimile for BCoV). It is possible that other MERS-CoV-like viruses also reside within DCs, but this does not detract from the definitive finding of MERS-CoV genetic sequences in both DCs and humans [117, 142, 143] . Screening studies have shown that juvenile DCs are more often positive for virus or viral RNA while older DCs are more likely to be seropositive and RNA or virus negative [76, 77, 144] . In adult DCs, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody, suggesting re-infection is possible [77, 144] . Viral loads among positive DCs can be very high [4, 76, 77, 139, 144] and DCs have been found positive both when ill with URT respiratory signs [77, 117, 142, 145] or when apparently healthy [137] . These findings indicate DCs host natural MERS-CoV infections. Furthermore, stored DC sera have revealed signs of MERS-CoV in DCs which date back over three decades (the earliest collected in 1983) [4, 133, 135] . Older sera have not been tested and so precisely how long DCs have been afflicted by MERS-CoV, whether the virus is enzootic among them, introduced to them decades or centuries ago from bats in Africa or the Arabian Peninsula, or they are the subject of regular but short-lived viral incursions from an as yet unknown host, cannot be answered. Researchers sought to determine a direction for infection; were DCs transmitting virus to humans or were humans infecting DCs? At a Qatari site, a farm owner and his employee became ill in mid-October 2013 and tested positive for MERS-CoV RNA in a sputum and throat swab sample, respectively. RT-rtPCRs found MERS-CoV RNA in 11 of 14 positive DC nasal swabs at the farm; six (43 %) positive by two or more assays [138] . The results indicated a recent outbreak had occurred in this herd; the first indication of MERS-CoV RNA found within DCs with a temporal association to human infections. Three positive DC samples were confirmed by sequencing a 358 nt portion of the spike gene; these sequences were identical to each other, again with close homology to other human and DC MERS-CoV sequences [138] . The DCs and human contacts yielded ORF1a and ORF4b sequences differing by only a single nucleotide each, clustering closely with the Hafr-Al-Batin_1_2013 variant [138] . Subsequent case studies found evidence of a concurrent human and DC infection and the direction of that infection was inferred to be from the ill DCs and to their human owners [117, 142, 146] . Partial genome sequences indicated that a human and a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive DC had been infected by a variant of the same virus, harbouring the same distinct pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms. [142] All nine DC in the owner's herd, serially sampled, reacted in a recombinant S1 antigen ELISA, with the two animals that had been RT-rtPCR positive showing a small, verifiable rise in antibody titre [142] . A rise in titre theoretically begins 10 to 21 days after DC infection [142] . The authors suggested that the rise in titre in DC sera which occurred alongside a declining RNA load, while the patient was actively ill and hospitalized, indicated that the DCs were infected first followed by the owner [117, 142] . BCoV antibodies were also present, and rising in one of the two RT-rtPCR positive animals but no animal's antibodies could neutralise BCoV infection [142] . Camel calving season occurs in the winter months (between late October and late February; Fig. 3 ) and this may be a time when there is increased risk to humans of spill-over due to new infections among naïve DC populations [128] . What role maternal camel antibody might play in delaying infection of calves remains unknown [128, 142] . Juvenile DCs appear to host active infection more often than adult DCs and thus the sacrificial slaughter of DCs, which must be five years of age or older (termed a thane), may not be accompanied by significant risk of exposure to infection. In contrast to earlier results, slaughterhouse workers who kill both younger and older DCs, may be an occupational group with significantly higher incidence of seropositivity to MERS-CoV when animals have active MERS-CoV infections [129, 139, [147] [148] [149] . Expanded virological investigations of African DCs may lead to more seropositive animals and geographic areas in which humans may be at risk. It is possible that there are areas where humans already harbour MERS-CoV infections that have not been identified because of an absence of laboratory surveillance. Virological investigations of bats may lead to findings of ancestral viruses and viral 'missing links' and identifying any other animal sources of zoonotic spread is important to inform options for reducing human exposures [56, 76] . Infectious MERS-CoV added to DC, goat or cow milk and stored at 4°C could be recovered at least 72 h later and, if stored at 22°C, recovery was possible for up to 48 h [150] . MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22°C but pasteurization completely ablated MERS-CoV infectivity [150] .Question: What is the the proportion of deaths among those infected with MERS-CoV?","answer":"above that for SARS-CoV"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Similarly, epiphysial growth relies on endochondral ossification from the circumferential secondary physeal [corrected]. injury can result in disruption of normal ossification. The cause of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) remains elusive. We hypothesized that juvenile OCD results from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the MRI appearance of the distal femoral epiphysis-particularly the secondary physis-of children with juvenile OCD and to compare these findings with the MRI findings of unaffected children.(MATERIALS AND METHODS) Knee MRI examinations of 30 children (age range, 8 years 8 months to 13 years 4 months) with OCD and 30 matched control patients were evaluated for skeletal maturity; location of the OCD lesion, if present; secondary physeal [corrected] continuity; overlying chondroepiphysial integrity, contour, and width; signal intensity of subchondral bone; and secondary physeal [corrected]conspicuity. Variables were compared using chi-square tests.(RESULTS) All children were skeletally immature. Condylar lesions were medial in 24 knees and lateral in six knees. All were in the middle one third, posterior one third, or middle and posterior thirds in the sagittal plane. The majority of lesions spanned the intercondylar and middle one third of the femoral condyle in the coronal plane (73%). There was a significant difference between secondary physeal [corrected] disruption in juvenile OCD condyles compared with unaffected condyles (p<0.001) and control condyles (p<0.001). Compared with unaffected and control condyles, the OCD group showed chondroepiphysial widening (p<0.001) and subchondral bone edema (p<0.001) on MRI. Neither chondroepiphysial integrity nor chondroepiphysial contour was significantly different between groups (p = 0.21, p = 0.31, respectively).Question:Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans: is it a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) gene plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport. Some ABCA1 gene polymorphisms have been associated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of three polymorphisms, C69 T, G378C, and G1051A (R219 K), on HDL-C levels and their interaction with BMI in more than 5000 French whites from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance syndrome) cohort study. The T allele of the C69 T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with higher HDL-C levels in normal-weight men (BMI < 25 kg/m (2)). The C allele of the G378C SNP was associated with lower HDL-C in overweight subjects (BMI > or = 25 kg/m (2)). For the G1051A SNP, in the normal-weight group, the minor A allele was significantly associated with higher HDL-C levels. In contrast, in overweight people, the minor allele was associated with lower HDL-C levels. After accounting for multiple testing, empiric p values remained significant for the associations between G378C SNP and HDL-C in the overweight group and between G1051A SNP and HDL-C in the normal-weight group. This study suggests that ABCA1 gene polymorphisms modulate HDL-C concentrations, in interaction with BMI, and, thus, they might influence cardiovascular risk in the general population.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Optical antennas represent an enabling technology for enhancing the detection of molecular vibrational signatures at low concentrations and probing the chemical composition of a sample in order to identify target molecules. However, efficiently detecting different vibrational modes to determine the presence (or the absence) of a molecular species requires a multispectral interrogation in a window of several micrometers, as many molecules present informative fingerprint spectra in the mid-infrared between 2.5 and 10 μm. As most nanoantennas exhibit a narrow-band response because of their dipolar nature, they are not suitable for such applications. Here, we propose the use of multifrequency optical antennas designed for operating with a bandwidth of several octaves. We demonstrate that surface-enhanced infrared absorption gains in the order of 10(5) can be easily obtained in a spectral window of 3 μm with attomolar concentrations of molecules, providing new opportunities for ultrasensitive broadband detection of molecular species via vibrational spectroscopy techniques.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

It was previously shown that polycistronic transcripts can undergo differential RNA decay, leaving some genes within the polycistron more stable than others, but the extent of regulation by differential mRNA decay or its evolutionary conservation remains unknown. Here, we find that a substantial fraction of E. coli genes display non-uniform mRNA stoichiometries despite being coded from the same operon. We further show that these altered operon stoichiometries are shaped post-transcriptionally by differential mRNA decay, which is regulated by RNA structures that protect specific regions in the transcript from degradation. These protective RNA structures are generally coded within the protein-coding regions of the regulated genes and are frequently evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, we provide evidence that differences in ribosome densities across polycistronic transcript segments, together with the conserved structural RNA elements, play a major role in the differential decay process. Our results highlight a major role for differential mRNA decay in shaping bacterial transcriptomes.Introduction:One of the defining features of bacterial gene expression is the co-transcription of multiple genes within polycistronic mRNAs[1]. Co-transcribed genes often encode proteins that participate in the same biological process or interact in a protein complex, allowing these genes to share the rate limiting steps of transcription. Thus, polycistronic transcription can synchronize the expression of functionally related genes, streamlining gene regulation in the compact genomes of bacteria. A major limitation of polycistronic transcription is that it theoretically generates equal amounts of mRNA for all genes sharing an operon. This can be disadvantageous in the common scenario where one of the proteins encoded in the operon is needed in higher amounts than the others. In many such cases this inconsistency is resolved by differential translation efficiencies of individual genes encoded on the same transcript[2, 3], or by internal transcription start sites( iTSSs) in the middle of the operon[4]. However, while differential translation efficiencies and iTSSs have been identified in many transcriptional units[2, 3, 5, 6], differential operon expression patterns cannot always be explained by such mechanisms. More than three decades ago it was shown that mRNA degradation can lead to differential mRNA stoichiometries for genes encoded on a single polycistron[7, 8]. This regulation by differential mRNA decay was demonstrated for the E. coli malEFG operon encoding the maltose ABC-transporter complex, where MalF and MalG form the transmembrane channel and MalE acts as the substrate-binding protein, which is needed in higher quantities[8]. It was shown that the 3’ portion of the polycistronic mRNA( including malFG) is rapidly degraded by RNases whereas the 5’ portion( malE) is stabilized, leading to accumulation of the malE mRNA and to a substantial relative increase of the MalE protein as compared to MalF and MalG[8]. While regulation via differential operon decay was reported in multiple bacterial operons over the last few decades[9–17], the extent of this regulatory mechanism or its evolutionary conservation in bacteria remains unknown. In this study, we combine a set of multi-layered high-resolution RNA-seq approaches to extensively map and characterize differentially decaying operons in E. coli. We find that regulation by differential decay is widespread and reshapes the stoichiometries of ~12% of polycistronic mRNAs in this model organism. This process is highly conserved also in the Salmonella and Enterobacter transcriptomes, and depends on conserved RNase-resistant RNA structures that guide the RNA decay dynamics. Furthermore, we find that differential decay is often dependent on translation and that stabilized operon segments are characterized by relatively higher ribosome densities than non-stabilized segments, suggesting that variation in translation efficiency guides endonuclease cleavage to ribosome depleted sections. Taken together, our data support differential operon decay as a common and frequently conserved mode of regulation in bacteria.Discussion:Differential decay of polycistronic operons enables bacteria to reshape uniform transcription into differential expression. This process has been studied for the last 3 decades in multiple different species and operons, including in malEFG[8], lacZYA[15], focA-pflB[43], and iscRSUA[10] in E. coli K12; papBA[12] and cfaAB[11] in pathogenic E. coli; pldB-yigL in Salmonella[13]; and pufBALMX[9] in Rhodobacter capsulatus. In the current study, we took a transcriptome-wide approach to extensively map differentially decaying operons in E. coli. We find that differential decay is a common mode of regulation in bacteria, involved in re-shaping the stoichiometry of at least 12% of the E. coli operons, in a manner conserved between related species. We note that this number may actually be higher as recent studies reported the existence of condition specific differential decay[10, 13]. The differential decay data produced in this study were organized into an interactive online browser that is available at: http://www. weizmann. ac. il/molgen/Sorek/operon_decay/. We show, using a combination of 3’ and 5’ RNA-termini sequencing, that protective RNA structures occur at the boundaries of stabilized operon segments in the vast majority of cases and are generally encoded within the protein-coding regions of the flanking, unstable genes. In addition, we find that the less stable genes in the operon are covered by fewer ribosomes per transcript and that translation plays a major role in shaping the differential decay process. While the relation between ribosomes and mRNA decay has been well-established for monocistronic mRNAs[39–41, 44], our results extend this concept to multi-gene operons with differentially decaying transcript segments. Importantly, these observations provide a potential explanation for how specific operon segments are selected for initial endonucleolytic cleavage by RNases with degenerate target motifs, a piece of the mechanism that was so far less understood( Fig 5). Interestingly, stable structures at protein-coding mRNA regions were previously suggested to reduce translation efficiency[44–46], implying that protective structures could actually play a dual role: first, blocking translation initiation, which reduces ribosome density on the flanking gene and exposes the region to increased RNase E dependent cleavage, and second, direct protection of the stable transcript region from the decay process. Although our differential decay models provide a potential mechanism for most of the regulated operons in our dataset, additional factors, such as trans-acting ncRNAs, have been found to play a role in shaping operon decay patterns by modulating access to rate-limiting endonuclease cleavage sites[10, 13]. Notably, such ncRNAs enable condition-specific stoichiometric regulation in operons that are otherwise degraded uniformly. Indeed, our analysis failed to detect differential decay in both the iscRSUA and the pldB-yigL operons, which were recently shown to be regulated by ncRNAs activated under conditions other than the ones employed in our study[10, 13]. Thus, considering the large number of trans-acting ncRNAs and antisense RNAs in bacteria, the extent of differential decay-based regulation is likely even greater than our current estimates. Whereas our proposed models for differential decay likely hold for other organisms that share similar RNA decay machineries( especially proteobacteria that rely on RNase E and 3’-to-5’ exonucleases similar to E. coli), many bacterial lineages harbor different RNase combinations and properties, for example 5’-3’ processive exonucleases in Firmicutes[30]. Presumably, differential decay in such organisms may rely on different principles or additional molecular signals.","answer":"Bacteria utilize operonic transcription to synchronize the expression of multiple consecutive genes .

[15] , Devlin et al. [3] , Radford et al. [16] , and many others have shown the benefits of large-scale pretraining on large, unlabeled corpora on a variety of downstream tasks in transfer learning settings.In particular, it has been shown that large-scale, attention-only language modeling via decoder-only transformers [11] as an unsupervised pretraining task admits the ability to perform zero-shot learning on meaningful tasks involving natural language generation [16] .Motivated by this, we propose a simple method that exhibits competitive performance on abstractive summarization without using sequence-to-sequence architectures or other standard tools in the neural abstractive summarization toolbox, and instead using a decoder-only transformer language model with transfer learning.This further illustrates the utility of finetuning language models trained on open domain text.This work puts forward a simple approach to abstractive summarization by viewing sequence transduction as a language modeling problem.We show the effectiveness of using decoder-only transformers for this task, in particular, when coupled with recent advances in large-scale language modeling and transfer learning.We show that competitive performance on two benchmark datasets is possible without many of the standard tools in neural abstractive summarization, such as sequence-tosequence modeling, coverage mechanisms, direct ROUGE optimization via reinforcement learning, or beam search, instead relying on a purely language modeling loss and simple decoding mechanisms such as nucleus sampling and greedy decoding.This approach yields highly fluent text, and illustrates the power of unsupervised representation learning-based transfer learning for downstream tasks.Table 3 : Comparison of with existing methods on XSum, reported in Narayan et al.

RATIONALE: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a drug efflux pump expressed, amongst others, on the luminal surface of the cerebral endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that antihistamines that are substrates of the P-gp transporter display no or minor central nervous system (CNS) effects as compared to antihistamines that are not P-gp transporter substrates. OBJECTIVES: The present study explored whether P-gp contributes in similar ways to the occurrence of sedative effects of antihistamines in humans. METHODS: An fMRI study was conducted according to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design in 13 healthy volunteers. Participants received cetirizine 15 mg (an antihistamine), verapamil 120 mg (a P-gp blocker), a combination of cetirizine + verapamil, and a placebo. Brain activity was assessed while conducting the attention network test (ANT) in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. The ANT measures three independent attention domains: i.e., alerting, orienting, and executive attention. It was expected that the combined treatment of cetirizine with verapamil would prevent efflux of cetirizine from the CNS, thus increasing attentional impairment, as compared to cetirizine administered alone. RESULTS: The present study provides evidence that the P-gp transporter is involved in central antihistamine effects in humans.

The results of several retrospective studies have also indicated potential benefit to improve survival of patients with GBM. Moreover, the promising treatment results of a phase 2 trial of concurrent radiation therapy, temozolomide, and VPA for patients with GBM have been recently reported.While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients.Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study.Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylaseSeveral clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patientsWhile there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patientsProlonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastomaProlonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma.Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival.Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase.Several uncontrolled retrospective case series and a post hoc analysis of the registration trial for temozolomide indicated an association between valproic acid (VPA) use and improved survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.To confirm the hypothesis suggested above, a combined analysis of survival association of antiepileptic drug use at the start of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide was performed in the pooled patient cohort (n = 1,869) of four contemporary randomized clinical trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma: AVAGlio (Avastin in Glioblastoma; NCT00943826), CENTRIC (Cilengitide, Temozolomide, and Radiation TSeveral clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).VPA may be preferred over an EIAED in patients with glioblastoma who require an AED during TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy.The combination of radiotherapy, temozolomide and valproic acid (VPA) has shown some promise in retrospective analyses of patients with glioblastoma, although their mechanisms of action remain unknown.We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of pretreating glioma cells with temozolomide and VPA as an immunization strategy to boost an adaptive immune response in a syngeneic mouse model.Temozolomide and VPA induced autophagy in GL261 glioma cells, and caused tumor antigen-specific T-cells to become activated effector T-cells.Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

(2017) as a method for probabilistic inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model.In contrast to prior methods for meta-learning via hierarchical Bayes, MAML is naturally applicable to complex function approximators through its use of a scalable gradient descent procedure for posterior inference.Furthermore, the identification of MAML as hierarchical Bayes provides a way to understand the algorithm’s operation as a meta-learning procedure, as well as an opportunity to make use of computational strategies for efficient inference.We use this opportunity to propose an improvement to the MAML algorithm that makes use of techniques from approximate inference and curvature estimation.A remarkable aspect of human intelligence is the ability to quickly solve a novel problem and to be able to do so even in the face of limited experience in a novel domain.Such fast adaptation is made possible by leveraging prior learning experience in order to improve the efficiency of later learning.This capacity for meta-learning also has the potential to enable an artificially intelligent agent to learn more efficiently in situations with little available data or limited computational resources BID45 BID4 BID37 .Inmachine learning, meta-learning is formulated as the extraction of domain-general information that can act as an inductive bias to improve learning efficiency in novel tasks (Caruana, 1998; BID52 . Thisinductive bias has been implemented in various ways: as learned hyperparameters in a hierarchical Bayesian model that regularize task-specific parameters BID18 , as a learned metric space in which to group neighbors BID7 , as a trained recurrent neural network that allows encoding and retrieval of episodic information BID43 , or as an optimization algorithm with learned parameters BID45 BID3 .The model-agnosticmeta-learning (MAML) of BID12 is an instance of a learned optimization procedure that directly optimizes the standard gradient descent rule. The algorithm estimatesan initial parameter set to be shared among the task-specific models; the intuition is that gradient descent from the learned initialization provides a favorable inductive bias for fast adaptation. However, this inductivebias has been evaluated only empirically in prior work BID12 .In this work, we presenta novel derivation of and a novel extension to MAML, illustrating that this algorithm can be understood as inference for the parameters of a prior distribution in a hierarchical Bayesian model. The learned prior allowsfor quick adaptation to unseen tasks on the basis of an implicit predictive density over task-specific parameters. The reinterpretation ashierarchical Bayes gives a principled statistical motivation for MAML as a meta-learning algorithm, and sheds light on the reasons for its favorable performance even among methods with significantly more parameters.More importantly, by casting gradient-based meta-learning within a Bayesian framework, we are able to improve MAML by taking insights from Bayesian posterior estimation as novel augmentations to the gradient-based meta-learning procedure. We experimentally demonstratethat this enables better performance on a few-shot learning benchmark.We have shown that model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) estimates the parameters of a prior in a hierarchical Bayesian model.By casting gradient-based meta-learning within a Bayesian framework, our analysis opens the door to novel improvements inspired by probabilistic machinery.As a step in this direction, we propose an extension to MAML that employs a Laplace approximation to the posterior distribution over task-specific parameters.This technique provides a more accurate estimate of the integral that, in the original MAML algorithm, is approximated via a point estimate.We show how to estimate the quantity required by the Laplace approximation using Kroneckerfactored approximate curvature (K-FAC), a method recently proposed to approximate the quadratic curvature of a neural network objective for the purpose of a second-order gradient descent technique.Our contribution illuminates the road to exploring further connections between gradient-based metalearning methods and hierarchical Bayesian modeling.For instance, in this work we assume that the predictive distribution over new data-points is narrow and well-approximated by a point estimate.We may instead employ methods that make use of the variance of the distribution over task-specific parameters in order to model the predictive density over examples from a novel task.Furthermore, it is known that the Laplace approximation is inaccurate in cases where the integral is highly skewed, or is not unimodal and thus is not amenable to approximation by a single Gaussian mode.This could be solved by using a finite mixture of Gaussians, which can approximate many density functions arbitrarily well BID49 BID0 .The exploration of additional improvements such as this is an exciting line of future work.","answer":"A specific gradient-based meta-learning algorithm, MAML, is equivalent to an inference procedure in a hierarchical Bayesian model.

While there are cross-cutting 'global' lessons, individual software projects exhibit many 'local' properties. This data heterogeneity makes drawing local conclusions from global data dangerous. A key research challenge is to construct locally accurate prediction models that are informed by global characteristics and data volumes. Previous work has tackled this problem using clustering and transfer learning approaches, which identify locally similar characteristics. This paper applies a simpler approach known as Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We show that hierarchical modeling supports cross-project comparisons, while preserving local context. To demonstrate the approach, we conduct a conceptual replication of an existing study on setting software metrics thresholds. Our emerging results show our hierarchical model reduces model prediction error compared to a global approach by up to 50 .Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Establishing credible thresholds is a central challenge for promoting source code metrics as an effective instrument to control the internal quality of software systems. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of relative thresholds for evaluating metrics data following heavy-tailed distributions. The proposed thresholds are relative because they assume that metric thresholds should be followed by most source code entities, but that it is also natural to have a number of entities in the “long-tail” that do not follow the defined limits. In the paper, we describe an empirical method for extracting relative thresholds from real systems. We also report a study on applying this method in a corpus with 106 systems. Based on the results of this study, we argue that the proposed thresholds express a balance between real and idealized design practices.[2]: Code metric analysis is a well-known approach for assessing the quality of a software system. However, current tools and techniques do not take the system architecture (e.g., MVC, Android) into account. This means that all classes are assessed similarly, regardless of their specific responsibilities. In this paper, we propose SATT (Software Architecture Tailored Thresholds), an approach that detects whether an architectural role is considerably different from others in the system in terms of code metrics, and provides a specific threshold for that role. We evaluated our approach on 2 different architectures (MVC and Android) in more than 400 projects. We also interviewed 6 experts in order to explain why some architectural roles are different from others. Our results shows that SATT can overcome issues that traditional approaches have, especially when some architectural role presents very different metric values than others.[3]: A wide variety of software metrics have been proposed and a broad range of tools is available to measure them. However, the effective use of software metrics is hindered by the lack of meaningful thresholds. Thresholds have been proposed for a few metrics only, mostly based on expert opinion and a small number of observations.[4]: Software metrics have been developed to measure the quality of software systems. A proper use of metrics requires thresholds to determine whether the value of a metric is acceptable or not. Many approaches propose to define thresholds based on large analyses of software systems. However it has been shown that thresholds depend greatly on the context of the project. Thus there is a need for an approach that computes thresholds by taking into account this context. In this paper we propose such approach with the objective to reach a trade-off between representativeness of the threshold and computation cost. Our approach is based on an unbiased selection of software entities and makes no assumptions on the statistical properties of the software metrics values. It can therefore be used by anyone, ranging from developer to manager, for computing a representative metric threshold tailored to their context.[5]: The statistical distributions of different software properties have been thoroughly studied in the past, including software size, complexity and the number of defects. In the case of object-oriented systems, these distributions have been found to obey a power law, a common statistical distribution also found in many other fields. However, we have found that for some statistical properties, the behavior does not entirely follow a power law, but a mixture between a lognormal and a power law distribution. Our study is based on the Qualitas Corpus, a large compendium of diverse Java-based software projects. We have measured the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics suite for every file of every Java project in the corpus. Our results show that the range of high values for the different metrics follows a power law distribution, whereas the rest of the range follows a lognormal distribution. This is a pattern typical of so-called double Pareto distributions, also found in empirical studies for other software properties.","answer":"Secondly, there is work that looks at . Since metrics were proposed for software, researchers have sought to identify what thresholds should trigger warnings. The paper we replicate from [2] has a good survey.

The metrics industry, e.g., SIG and CAST, has also long used databases of company performance (a global pool) as benchmarks for evaluating new clients."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We experimentally demonstrate that plasmonic nanoparticles embedded in the evanescent field of subwavelength optical waveguides (WGs) are highly sensitive to distances normal to the propagation of light, showing an ∼10× increase in spatial resolution compared to the optical field decay of the WG. The scattering cross-section of the Au nanoparticle is increased by the plasmon-dielectric coupling interaction when the nanoparticle is placed near the dielectric surface of the WG, and the decay of the scattering signal is enhanced, showing angstrom level distance sensitivity within 10 nm from the WG. Numerical studies with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method correlate well with the experimental results. To demonstrate real-time monitoring of a single molecule stretching in the evanescent field, we linked individual single-stranded DNA molecules between the WG and plasmonic nanoparticles and pushed on the nanoparticles with fluidic forces. The simple design and ease of obtaining optical feedback on molecular displacements makes our approach ideal for new in situ force sensing devices, imaging technologies, and high-throughput molecular analysis.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Au\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Three overlapping cDNA clones covering the entire primary sequence of the bile salt stimulated lipase in human milk were isolated from a human breast lambda gt10 cDNA library by screening with the rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase cDNA. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA showed that the human milk lipase mRNA encodes a 748-residue protein, including a 23-residue signal peptide. The human milk lipase cDNA is highly homologous to rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase, suggesting that the milk lipase may be identical to the cholesterol esterase in human pancreas. This conclusion was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of the cDNA for human pancreatic cholesterol esterase.

Recent studies have revealed a close relationship between transcription, histone modification, and RNA processing. In fact, genome-wide analyses that correlate histone marks with RNA processing signals raise the possibility that specific RNA processing factors may modulate transcription and help to \\" write \\" chromatin marks. Here we show that the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC) directs recruitment of transcription elongation factors and establishes proper histone marks during active transcription. A directed genetic screen revealed that deletion of either subunit of the CBC confers a synthetic growth defect when combined with deletion of genes encoding either Ctk2 or Bur2, a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of P-TEFb. The CBC physically associates with these complexes to recruit them during transcription and mediates phosphorylation at Ser-2 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. To understand how these interactions influence downstream events, histone H3K36me3 was examined, and we demonstrate that CBCΔ affects proper Set2-dependent H3K36me3. Consistent with this, the CBC and Set2 have similar effects on the ability to rapidly induce and sustain activated gene expression, and these effects are distinct from other histone methyltransferases. This work provides evidence for an emerging model that RNA processing factors can modulate the recruitment of transcription factors and influence histone modification during elongation.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

After routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy and insertion of a suprahepatic suction drain, patients were randomized to suction or no suction on the drain. The time course of the severity of wound, abdominal and shoulder tip pain was assessed by visual analogue scales administered in the morning and afternoon of the first 3 postoperative days. The control group had a high incidence of shoulder tip pain similar to that after gynaecological laparoscopy. Patients in the treatment group reported significantly less shoulder tip pain than the control group (O.R. 0.16, 95% CI, 0.06-0.40). There was a tendency for the treatment group to report reduced abdominal and, to a lesser extent, wound pain. The authors recommend suprahepatic suction as a simple and more effective way to improve patient comfort after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Title 2:Effect of drainage on postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Abstract 2:Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with a high incidence of postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting. Pneumoperitoneum created during the operation and residual gas after the operation are two of the factors in postoperative pain and nausea. We studied the effects of a subdiaphragmatic gas drain, which is intended to decrease the residual gas, on postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.                Seventy patients were randomized into two demographically and clinically comparable groups: drainage and control. Postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting were measured by verbal grading and visual analog scale 2-72 h postoperatively. Analgesic and antiemetic use and incidence of retching, vomiting and other complaints were also recorded.                Subdiaphragmatic drain effectively reduced the incidence and amount of subdiaphragmatic gas bubble. The incidence and severity of nausea was lower in the drainage group at 72 h. Although severity of pain was lower at 8 and 12 h in the drainage group, the difference was not significant. There was also no difference between the groups in regard to analgesic and antiemetic use.                Subdiaphragmatic drain offers only minor, if any, benefit on postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and this effect is probably clinically irrelevant.Title 3:The effect of drains in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Abstract 3:A prospective controlled randomized study was performed on 100 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy to evaluate the benefit of routine drainage in simple uncomplicated procedures. The 100 patients were randomized into two groups. Group 1 patients (n = 50) had a drain placed through the epigastric trocar site. The drain was removed before their discharge unless bile or blood was present. Group 2 patients (n = 50) did not have a drain placed. Eleven patients in group 2 (no drain) (22%) were discharged on the same day of surgery (within 8 h), and the remaining 89 patients in both groups were discharged the day after surgery (within 23 h). There were no wound infections or postoperative fever in either group. There were minor but not statistically significant differences between the two groups in postoperative severity and duration of abdominal pain, shoulder pain, and nausea. Furthermore, the two groups were similar in respect to postoperative recovery time and return to work.","answer":"Drain use after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy increases wound infection rates and delays hospital discharge.

More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series.","answer":"G380R"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  What makes a successful informal learning space is a topic in need of further research. The body of discourse on informal space design is drawn from learning theory, placemaking, and architecture, with a need for understanding of the synergy between the three. Findings from a longitudinal, quantitative, and qualitative study at Sheffield Hallam University, explore learners' behaviors, attitudes, and preferences toward informal learning spaces in higher education, within and outside of the context of the academic library. The learning spaces study contributes to the discourse on informal learning spaces design by producing a typology of nine learning space preference attributes which address aspects of learning theory, placemaking, and architecture. The typology can be used to evaluate existing spaces and inform redevelopment of informal learning spaces in higher education institutions. Implementing the typology will be subject to localized conditions, but at Sheffield Hallam University the key conclusions... 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  University libraries have had to provide acceptable noise levels for many years and this pressure has not diminished in the twenty-first century. Library space has to be utilized to ensure noise levels are best managed. A study was undertaken across four university libraries in South Florida to determine how universities utilized their limited space to satisfy both individual and collaborative study needs of their students. Directors and key librarians were surveyed and interviewed, and on-site visits were conducted. Results supported findings from the literature indicating that it is best to observe students’ natural use of library space and designate those areas accordingly. Additionally, it was found that current pedagogical practices place a greater need for group study spaces, which compete against the vital need for quiet study areas. It was also discovered that designated floor levels used to separate sound are compromised by popular open mezzanine designs that allow sound to permeate between floor... 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to offer an exploratory investigation of students' use of informal learning spaces for their studies at the University of Sheffield. Previous research has mainly focused on formal learning spaces such as libraries and lecture theatres, but there is an increasing recognition of the value of informal learning spaces such as coffee bars. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaires, observations and interviews were the sources of data for the study. The research approach particularly looked at how students used informal learning spaces and what their perceptions of the spaces were. Findings – Analysis showed that students found that the background atmosphere greatly influenced their choice of study location and that technological devices were only used sparingly. Students adapted their study habits to fit the learning spaces that they liked. Originality/value – Although, attention is often paid to the furniture and colour schemes in libraries, this article makes librari... 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of an electronic noise-monitoring device (NoiseSign) at reducing noise levels in quiet study areas in an academic library. Design/methodology/approach – Surveys and decibel-level measurements were used to measure the perceived and objective noise levels, respectively, in both an intervention and a control area of two major branch libraries. Patrons’ perception of noise was measured with a passive paper and online survey, which asked patrons to rate the current noise level and their desired noise level. The actual noise measurements were collected twice a day with a hand-held decibel reader for 60 seconds and then corroborated after the intervention with automatically logged decibel readings from the noise monitor device in the two intervention areas. The authors conducted one-way ANOVA’s to determine if the results were significant. Findings – The NoiseSign had no statistically significant effect on either actual noise levels or user perceptions... 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  This article describes a qualitative mixed-method study of students’ perceptions of place and space in an academic library. The approach is informed by Scott Bennett’s model of library design, which posits a shift from a ‘book-centered’ to a technology supported ‘learning centered’ paradigm of library space. Two surveys gathered data on (a) students’ perceptions of places in an academic library, and (b) on occupancy rates in the same library. When triangulated, the results identified two distinct and contrasting models of place: a more traditional model based on individual study near stacks of books, and an emergent technologically-supported group study model. The results suggest that academic libraries should develop new metrics to measure library place and space in settings of technologically-supported group work. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate similar and different wayfinding strategies used by novice and expert patrons at an academic library. Design/methodology/approach – The study employed a usability study approach. In total, 12 people, places, or things were identified as important for students to be able to locate within an academic library. Students from one of three groups (high school, freshmen, and seniors) were randomly assigned a scenario requiring them to find the indicated person, place, or thing. Student researchers video recorded participants and took field notes during the wayfinding activity and conducted an interview about participant’s experience following the exercise. Findings – Total and average time needed to locate the person, place, or thing indicated in the scenario were determined for each group. In addition, wayfinding tools (signs, maps, help desks, technology, and experience) used by participants were identified. Originality/value – The research compares novice ... 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  The University of Houston Libraries implemented Primo as the primary search option on the library website in May 2014. In May 2015, the Libraries released a redesigned interface to improve user experience with the tool. The Libraries took a user-centered approach to redesigning the Primo interface by conducting a \\"think-aloud\\" usability test in order to gather user feedback and identify needed improvements. This article describes the methodology and findings from the usability study, the changes that were made to the Primo interface as a result, and implications for discovery system vendor relations and library instruction.Literature Review:","answer":"User feedback as a management tool an anti-seat hogging video was posted on YouTube called \\"Share it, Give it up!\\" appealing to users to consider others. Noise Level Surveys aim to determine the acceptable noise levels in various areas of the library so that furniture may be arranged to minimize noise and allow effective study. McGill University, Canada BIB005 explored the effectiveness of a noise-monitoring device in reducing actual and perceived noise levels in an intervention and a control area at two branch libraries. The actual noise measurements were collected twice a day and then corroborated after the intervention with readings from the noise-monitor device. They found that the noise-monitoring device had no statistically significant effect on actual or perceived noise levels. However, they were able to identify the areas where noise toleration was low. A seat mapping survey at Drexel University's BIB006 also revealed some surprising data on noise tolerance levels. They found that some of the high-occupancy areas were considered quiet, whereas some of the low-occupancy areas were perceived as noisy. Temple University's  study confirmed the connection between noise levels and furniture. They found that in areas with comfortable furniture where food and drink were permitted the noise levels were higher than in other areas and should be separated from quiet study areas. A more recent study by four South Florida university libraries BIB003 ) on individual and collaborative study needs revealed a high demand for designated and sound-proofed group study areas. A survey at Sheffield Hallam University library BIB002 ) also confirmed the importance of silent, quiet, and group areas for successful study. Using observational sweeps and a photographic mapping exercise, they identified the need for clearly defined learning environments -silent, quiet, and group zones. Conversely, another study at Sheffield Hallam University using multiple methods showed that a relaxed, somewhat noisy atmosphere had a positive effect on studying, and was often students' preferred choice of study location for this reason BIB004 . A creative solution to the noise issue was implemented by the University of New Hampshire  following its \\"In the Zone@UNH\\" scheme, whereby librarians placed \\"Respect the Q\\" notes on the desks of noise offenders asking them to be quiet, as well as notes encouraging them to send text messages if they have noise complaints. Other solutions such as noise monitors, zoning, sound-proof partitioning, and improved signage were implemented at the University of Limerick, Ireland  after follow-up to their LibQUAL+ ® question \\"a quiet space for individual work\\". The second category of user feedback is the Navigation Survey which aims to determine the obstacles users encounter when navigating the physical and electronic library. The most common method of testing physical navigation is the Wayfinding survey, while the most common method of testing electronic navigation is the Usability survey. Wayfinding focuses on the extent to which library users find what they are looking for in a timely manner, and whether the shelf arrangement and signage are clear enough so that they are autonomous in doing so. Participants are given several assignments and filmed using video or mobile devices such as phones, tablets, or \\"GoPro\\" cameras. Solutions typically involve improving floor, ceiling, and shelf signage, and improving the visibility of print and electronic maps. Following LibQUAL+ ® comments about difficulties locating items in the library, the University of Chicago library  conducted a Wayfinding study by asking users to locate three specific items. The findings demonstrated that none of the participants could find all three items in the correct location due to a number of 216 PMM 17,3 obstacles; and as a result, a comprehensive and consistent sign system was implemented. Multiple shelving sequences were combined into a single collection, clearer terminology was adopted, and directional aids were created to highlight the distinction between reference and circulating collections. After fixing most of the problems raised in the first study,  conducted a second study which showed that four out of ten participants were able to find all three items without prompting. Although many of the 2005 problems appear to have been rectified, a few new ones were uncovered, such as the confusion over call numbers and directional map use. A study based on Larsen and Tatarka's methodology was conducted at the University of Haifa in 2008  and produced similar results. Another Wayfinding study at the University of Pennsylvania using \\"Depthmap\\" software BIB001 showed that the layout of the library building and visual access predicted how well users found the items they needed. Other aspects such as signs or individual characteristics of users were also found to play a role in Wayfinding performance. A more recent study BIB007 at Brigham Young University highlighted the difference between novices and experienced users. Novices used a combination of signage, maps, service desks, computers and smartphones, and had more problems with call numbers than experienced users. Usability Testing aims to determine the extent to which the library's website and catalog are easy to use and useful, and what information could be added or removed in order to improve the experience. At the University of Haifa  students and faculty were given tasks such as: \\"Find the library map\\", \\"Find the library opening hours\\", \\"Find information on interlibrary loans services\\". All transactions and out-loud thinking were recorded using \\"Screen Recorder\\" and audio software. Although most questions were answered easily, the Electronic Offprints was moved to a different section of the website as a result of this study. Another type of usability study was conducted by the University of Houston BIB008 using \\"Morae Usability Software\\". Participants were recruited at the entrance to the library and asked to perform two tasks likely to be needed for class assignments or for general research on a laptop. They found that participants expected call numbers to be linked to an electronic stacks guide or map. The third category of user feedback is the satisfaction survey which aims to determine the extent of overall satisfaction with the library's services, collections, and space thereby highlighting areas for improvement. Satisfaction survey are usually conducted as online surveys posted on a website and/or sent by e-mail to a representative sample or to the whole population. The most widely used library satisfaction survey is LibQUAL+ ® an international survey maintained by American Research Libraries (ARL) that has been translated into over 20 languages and used by over 1,200 libraries worldwide in 17 countries. The advantages of LibQUAL+ ® are its benchmarking opportunities and the fact that all the data are maintained and collated by ARL. LibQUAL+ ® Lite, an abbreviated eight-question version of the survey was introduced in Hebrew and English in 2009 and showed that similar insights could be obtained with fewer questions and that completion rates were higher than with the regular 22-question protocol"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein) initiates base excision repair by severing the glycosylic bond of numerous damaged bases. In comparison, homologues of the Rad23 proteins (hHR23) and the hXPC protein are involved in the recognition of damaged bases in global genome repair, a subset of nucleotide excision repair. In this report, we show that the hHR23A and -B also interact with the MPG protein and can serve as accessory proteins for DNA damage recognition in base excision repair. Furthermore, the MPG.hHR23 protein complex elevates the rate of MPG protein-catalyzed excision from hypoxanthine-containing substrates. This increased excision rate is correlated with a greater binding affinity of the MPG protein-hHR23 protein complex for damaged DNA. These data suggest that the hHR23 proteins function as universal DNA damage recognition accessory proteins in both of these major excision repair pathways.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"MPG\\", \\"hXPC\\", \\"3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase\\", \\"hHR23\\", \\"hHR23A and -B\\", \\"RAD23\\", \\"3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase\\", \\"Rad23\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Three hundred eighteen authors of published trials were asked whether they had participated in any unpublished RCTs .  The 156 respondents reported 271 unpublished and 1041 published trials . Of the 178 completed unpublished RCTs with a trend specified , 26 ( 14 % ) favored the new therapy compared to 423 of 767 ( 55 % ) published reports ( p less than 0.001 ) . For trials that were completed but not published , the major reasons for nonpublication were \\" negative \\" results and lack of interest . From the data provided , it appears that nonpublication was primarily a result of failure to write up and su bmi t the trial results rather than rejection of su bmi tted manuscripts . The results of this study imply the existence of a publication bias of importance both to meta- analysis and the interpretation of statistically significant positive trialsTitle 2:A double-blind, long-term study of tizanidine ('Sirdalud') in spasticity due to cerebrovascular lesions.Abstract 2:A double-blind study was carried out in 30 patients suffering from spasticity due to cerebrovascular lesions to compare the long-term efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine hydrochloride with that of baclofen . A 2-week titration phase identified the optimum dose of tizanidine ( max . 20 mg/day ) or baclofen ( max . 50 mg/day ) in each patient . Patients were then treated with this dose for a 50-week maintenance phase . Efficacy and tolerability parameters were evaluated first on a monthly and then on a bimonthly basis . Both tizanidine and baclofen caused an improvement in the symptoms associated with spasticity . In end-point analysis , 87 % of patients showed an improvement ( p less than 0.01 ) in excessive muscle tone - the major efficacy parameter in this study - in the tizanidine group , while 79 % improved ( p less than 0.01 ) in the baclofen group . Side-effects in the tizanidine group were mild and transient and no patients discontinued the study ; in the baclofen group , 3 patients discontinued the study due to severe side-effects . However , both drugs were assessed as effective and fairly well tolerated in the long-term . Although there were no statistically significant differences between the two drugs , the global assessment of antispastic efficacy revealed a nearly significant difference ( p = 0.057 ) in favour of tizanidine and the global assessment of tolerability was also in favour of tizanidineTitle 3:Long-term treatment with dantrolene sodium of stroke patients with spasticity limiting the return of function.Abstract 3:A study was carried out to determine the efficacy and long-term safety of dantrolene in treating stroke patients with spasticity limiting rehabilitation . Fifteen of the 18 patients studied experienced reduction in spasticity and clinical improvement after treatment with dantrolene sodium for 6 weeks . Fourteen of these patients participated in a 6-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . The 5 patients who continued to receive dantrolene did not experience clinical deterioration . However , the 9 patients given placebo noted increased deficits . Seven asked that the blind be broken and chose to resume dantrolene therapy . After 6 weeks , 13 of the 14 patients elected to continue on dantrolene ( average dose 165.4 mg/day ) . All continued to improve . Side-effects were generally mild and transient . Although these patients took other drugs concomitantly , no drug interactions were reportedTitle 4:Objective assessment of spasticity, strength, and function with early exhibition of dantrolene sodium after cerebrovascular accident: a randomized double-blind study.Abstract 4:A double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine whether early exhibition of Dantrium ( Dantrolene Sodium ) in patients with cerebrovascular accidents , before the onset of significant spasticity , would enhance the functional outcome of rehabilitation . Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in the trial and 31 satisfactorily completed the study . A modified Cybex isokinetic dynamometer was used to gather information on strength and muscle tone . Clinical , functional , and biochemical data were also collected . It was found that Dantrium reduced strength in the unaffected limbs but did not alter strength in the paretic limbs . Dantrium produced no alteration in clinical tone , functional outcome , or biochemical tests at the dosage ( 200 mg per day ) used in this studyTitle 5:A multi-centre, double-blind trial of tizanidine, a new antispastic agent, in spasticity associated with hemiplegia.Abstract 5:A double-blind study was carried out in 105 patients with chronic spasticity associated with hemiplegia in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine with that of diazepam . Dosage was increased progressively , if tolerated , to a maximum of 24 mg tizanidine or 30 mg diazepam per day at the end of 2 weeks . The optimum dosage was then maintained for 6 weeks . Efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed after 2 and 8-weeks ' therapy . Patients on tizanidine but not those on diazepam showed a statistically significant improvement in functional status , as assessed by walking distance on flat ground . Analysis of the stretch reflex in four groups of muscles showed that both tizanidine and diazepam reduced the duration of contractions and increased the angle at which contraction occurred , but there were no significant differences between the two drugs . Clonus of the triceps surae resolved in 48 % of tizanidine and 40 % of diazepam patients . Evaluation of the effect of therapy revealed an improvement with each drug in approximately 83 % of patients , with the overall evaluation being slightly ( but non-significantly ) in favour of tizanidine . There were fewer discontinuations of treatment in the tizanidine group as a result of side-effects . It would appear , therefore , that tizanidine is an effective and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of cerebral spasticityTitle 6:Gabapentin for the treatment of spasticity in patients with spinal cord injuryAbstract 6:Our serendipitous observations suggested that some patients with spasticity appeared to have improved following the administration of the anticonvulsant drug gabapentin . As some patients with spasticity are either refractory to or intolerant of established medical treatments , we conducted this study to investigate the effect of gabapentin on spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury . Twenty-five patients with spinal cord injury and spasticity received oral gabapentin ( 2400 mg over 48 h ) in a r and omized , double blind , placebo-controlled crossover study . We assessed responses by measuring the Ashworth spasticity scale , muscle stretch reflexes , presence of clonus and reflex response to noxious stimuli . Patient ratings were obtained using a Likert Scale . Administration of gabapentin , but not placebo , was associated with an 11 % reduction in spasticity as measured by the Ashworth Scale ( P=0.04 ) and by a 20 % reduction in the Likert Scale ( P=0.0013 ) . Significant changes were not obtained for the other measures .

A high throughput in vivo model system is needed to validate gene associations with pathology. We developed a Drosophila-based functional system to screen candidate disease genes identified from Congenital Heart Disease( CHD) patients. 134 genes were tested in the Drosophila heart using RNAi-based gene silencing. Quantitative analyses of multiple cardiac phenotypes demonstrated essential structural, functional, and developmental roles for more than 70 genes, including a subgroup encoding histone H3K4 modifying proteins. We also demonstrated the use of Drosophila to evaluate cardiac phenotypes resulting from specific, patient-derived alleles of candidate disease genes. We describe the first high throughput in vivo validation system to screen candidate disease genes identified from patients. This approach has the potential to facilitate development of precision medicine approaches for CHD and other diseases associated with genetic factors.Introduction:A major problem confronting large-scale genomic sequencing studies of disease patients is to identify those genetic variants that actually represent disease-causing mutations. This is particularly true for candidate genes that have not previously been evaluated in an experimental model system for involvement in disease-relevant biological processes. Functional gene validation systems in model organisms are therefore essential. While a definitive assignment of disease association should be established through the analysis of mutant gene phenotypes in a mammalian model, this approach is not practical for rapid high-throughput initial screening of large numbers of candidate genes. Drosophila, by contrast, possesses the attributes of a simple animal model system that make it ideally suited for this role( Bier, 2005; Chien et al., 2002). Use of Drosophila as a model to elucidate molecular disease mechanisms is well established and amply documented( Cagan, 2011; Na et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013; Diop and Bodmer, 2015; Bier and Bodmer, 2004; Owusu-Ansah and Perrimon, 2014). It has been established that 75% of human disease associated genes are represented in the fly genome by functional homologs( Reiter et al., 2001). Although it is difficult to directly link Drosophila developmental defects to patient symptoms, the Drosophila system can serve as a testing platform for gene function in development, which can be used to test disease association for a large number of candidate genes identified from patient genomic sequencing. Congenital heart disease( CHD) affects 0. 8% of live births( Hoffman, 1990, 2002; Reller et al., 2008). Genetic factors are strongly implicated in CHD pathogenesis, but the great majority of genes( accounting for an estimated 75% of cases) remain unidentified( Gelb et al., 2013). Drosophila has served as a model to study genes related to CHD for over 20 years, based on the evolutionarily conserved genetic basis of heart development( Bier and Bodmer, 2004; Olson, 2006; Yi et al., 2006). The Drosophila heart( Figure 1A) is a rhythmically beating linear tube composed of parallel rows of fused contractile cardiac cells, flanked by adherent pericardial cells( Vogler and Bodmer, 2015). The heart functions to maintain circulation of hemolymph( insect ‘blood’) throughout the body cavity. In a typical beating cycle, hemolymph enters the posteriorly-located heart chamber in the abdomen and is pumped anteriorly through the aorta towards the head and brain. Although structurally of relatively low complexity, Drosophila and human heart development are both largely directed by the same highly conserved regulatory networks( Vogler and Bodmer, 2015). To demonstrate that the fly is the ideal in vivo animal model for cost-effective, rapidly informative, and efficient screening of candidate disease genes, we have developed a Drosophila validation system to screen candidate genes identified in a large-scale genomic sequencing study of congenital heart disease patients. 10. 7554/eLife. 22617. 003Figure 1. Drosophila adult heart structure and tissue visualization, evaluation of 1X vs. 4X Hand enhancer constructs driving heart specific silencing of gene expression.( A) Drosophila heart structure and visualization. Left: the adult heart is depicted schematically in green. Supporting lateral alary muscles are depicted in red. Middle: fluorescence microscopy of dissected heart tissue spanning abdominal segments A2–A5. Myocardial actin filaments( cardiac myofibers) were visualized by Phalloidin staining( red), which also stained somatic muscle fibers in segments A2, A3, and A4 and alary muscle fibers in A5. GFP( green) labels cardiomyocytes and pericardial nephrocytes. Expression of a nuclear-localized GFP transgene was controlled by the cardioblast specific Hand gene enhancer element. Scale bar = 100 µ. Right: higher magnification of segment A4 heart tissue. Scale bar = 50 µ. In this example, dissection and preparation for microscopy involved removal of a layer of longitudinal muscle, which resulted in the loss of some cardiomyocytes and pericardial nephrocytes. In situ, the heart tube is composed of parallel, symmetrical rows of cardiomyocytes( small nuclei), flanked by pericardial nephrocytes( large nuclei).( B) The 4XHand enhancer promotes significantly greater Gal4 mRNA production than the single Hand enhancer. The Gal4 mRNA level in the dissected adult heart was determined by qRT-PCR. Statistical significance( *) was defined as p<0. 05. w1118 was used as a negative control since it does not express any Gal4.( C) Compared to the single Hand enhancer, 4XHand induced significantly greater knockdown of CG8184( the homolog of human HUWE1) mRNA when driving expression of the CG8184-IR RNAi silencing transgene. The CG8184 mRNA level in the dissected adult heart was determined by qRT-PCR. Statistical significance( *) was defined as p<0. 05.( D) Compared to the single Hand enhancer, 4XHand induced significantly greater knockdown of Lid( the homolog of human KDM5A and KDM5B) mRNA when driving expression of the Lid-IR RNAi silencing transgene. The Lid mRNA level in the dissected adult heart was determined by qRT-PCR. Statistical significance( *) was defined as p<0. 05. In C and D, Control flies were the progeny of a cross between homozygous 4XHand-Gal4 and w1118, which has one copy of 4xHand-Gal4 but does not carry a UAS-RNAi silencing construct.

Male and female flies of the appropriate genotypes were crossed to produce progeny flies carrying the indicated UAS-gene silencing( i. e. RNAi) interfering RNA( IR) construct, the expression of which is directed specifically in cardioblast cells by the indicated Hand-Gal4 driver. Hand-Gal4 and 4X-Hand-Gal4 constructs incorporate either one copy or four tandem copies of a Hand gene enhancer element, respectively. Significant developmental lethal effects of heart-specific gene silencing were only observed in progeny flies carrying the 4XHand-Gal4 driver. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22617. 004 In 2013 the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium( PCGC) published a large-scale sequence analysis of sporadically occurring CHD cases( Zaidi et al., 2013), providing an opportunity to conduct systematic model system based experimental studies into the genetic basis of CHD, informed from the outset by clinical data. Such studies will ultimately facilitate the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approaches, and precision medicine interventions( Ashley, 2015) for CHD. The initial report( Zaidi et al., 2013) of 249 protein-altering de novo mutations from 362 severe cases of CHD identified 223 candidate disease genes involved in diverse biochemical pathways, with 26 genes selected as particular genes-of-interest based upon bioinformatics criteria( Zaidi et al., 2013). We used Drosophila developmental genetics to quantitatively evaluate the phenotypes associated with heart-specific RNAi mediated gene silencing of fly homologs of mutated candidate disease genes. 174 genes( 78%) had clear fly homologs, consistent with the published estimate of 75% conservation of disease gene homologs( Reiter et al., 2001). Interestingly, the ‘top 26’ genes identified by the PCGC study( Zaidi et al., 2013) all have conserved Drosophila homologs. Some of these genes were previously identified as having roles in Drosophila heart development, in the context of a global in vivo RNAi screen for candidate fly heart genes.( Neely et al., 2010) The current study used a stronger heart-specific driver to validate candidate CHD genes. We developed a highly efficient cardiac-targeted gene silencing approach in flies, and used this to examine effects on heart structure and function for fly homologs of 134 candidate disease genes published by the PCGC. We employed a quantitative phenotypic screening protocol that evaluated developmental lethality( pre-adult mortality), heart structure( Figure 1A; including morphology, cardiac myofibrillar density, cardiac collagen deposition, and cardioblast cell number) and adult longevity. We found that 52% of the tested fly homologs are required for cardiac development and function in flies. We also developed a gene replacement testing strategy involving simultaneous heart-specific silencing of an endogenous fly gene homolog and expression of either wild type or patient-derived mutant alleles of the candidate human disease gene.Discussion:Our results demonstrate the value of the Drosophila model system to functionally screen and validate candidate disease genes identified through large scale sequencing efforts. The high-throughput testing platform described here can extend gene association data to quantitative, in vivo morphological and functional criteria. On the basis of this screening, the most promising genes can justifiably be advanced to more costly, time consuming, and technically challenging validation platforms required to definitively identify and confirm disease-causing gene variants. Such advanced testing, we presume, will encompass gene function analysis in a mammalian model system. The advantages of functional screening using RNAi-based silencing lines are to some extent offset by certain limitations. From the outset, of human disease genes, approximately 25% are not represented by Drosophila homologs. False negatives may occur if RNAi expression does not sufficiently reduce mRNA levels. However, we tested a number of RNAi lines by qRT-PCR and found no examples of ineffective gene silencing. False negatives may also occur when missense mutations produce gain-of-function( GOF) alleles, and we cannot accurately predict the degree to which this could confound our analysis. This problem, we note, is mitigated to a degree by the fact that genes altered by GOF mutations would in many instances normally encode proteins with cardiac cell functions, and thus yield silencing induced phenotypes in our functional screening system. False positives can arise from so-called ‘off target’ effects of a given RNAi targeting construct. We controlled against misleading results from both RNAi silencing inefficiency and off target effects by employing the latest-generation available RNAi lines, and testing multiple such lines for each of the top 26 candidate genes. This precaution against false negative and false positive results further limited the total number of candidate genes we could screen to 134( 60% of the CHD candidate genes published by the PCGC). Nevertheless, our in vivo screening system rapidly and efficiently confirmed roles in heart development, tissue maintenance, or cardiac function for 72 candidate genes. Phenotypic analysis based on gene silencing, while effective for high throughput screening, represents a first step in validation and characterization of candidate mutations. We also demonstrated an initial ‘gene replacement’ strategy that takes further advantage of the available resources and sophisticated genetics of the Drosophila model system to quantitatively characterize the phenotype induced by expression of a specific patient-derived mutant allele. This approach may prove highly valuable as a testing platform for precision medicine based therapeutic drugs. Ultimately, the knowledge that a specific mutation contributes to disease pathogenesis opens the door to the application of precise gene-editing interventions, strategies for which are currently being developed based on CRISPR/Cas-9 mediated genome editing( Long et al., 2016; Carroll et al., 2016; Long et al., 2014). The high throughput candidate gene validation studies reported here represent the essential first step in the functional confirmation, phenotypic characterization, and ultimate precision treatment of disease-associated mutations.","answer":"Around one in 100 children are born with heart defects caused by congenital heart disease .

Abstract:Several related human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are endemic in the human population, causing mild respiratory infections1.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a recent zoonotic infection that has quickly reached pandemic spread2,3.Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses is thought to occur in the absence of pre-existing immunity in the target human population.Using diverse assays for detection of antibodies reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein, we demonstrate the presence of pre-existing immunity in uninfected and unexposed humans to the new coronavirus.SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies, exclusively of the IgG class, were readily detectable by a sensitive flow cytometry-based method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals with recent HCoV infection and targeted the S2 subunit.In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, as well as concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies throughout the observation period of 6 weeks since symptoms onset.HCoV patient sera also variably reacted with SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleocapsid (N), but not with the S1 subunit or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S on standard enzyme immunoassays.Notably, HCoV patient sera exhibited specific neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes, according to levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera.Distinguishing pre-existing and de novo antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for serology, seroprevalence and vaccine studies, as well as for our understanding of susceptibility to and natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","answer":"{\\"verdict\\": \\"NEI\\", \\"evidence\\": []}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:We propose a unified framework for building unsupervised representations of individual objects or entities (and their compositions), by associating with each object both a distributional as well as a point estimate (vector embedding).This is made possible by the use of optimal transport, which allows us to build these associated estimates while harnessing the underlying geometry of the ground space.Our method gives a novel perspective for building rich and powerful feature representations that simultaneously capture uncertainty (via a distributional estimate) and interpretability (with the optimal transport map).As a guiding example, we formulate unsupervised representations for text, in particular for sentence representation and entailment detection.Empirical results show strong advantages gained through the proposed framework.This approach can be used for any unsupervised or supervised problem (on text or other modalities) with a co-occurrence structure, such as any sequence data.The key tools underlying the framework are Wasserstein distances and Wasserstein barycenters (and, hence the title!).One of the main driving factors behind the recent surge of interest and successes in natural language processing and machine learning has been the development of better representation methods for data modalities.Examples include continuous vector representations for language (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) , convolutional neural network (CNN) based text representations (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Severyn and Moschitti, 2015; BID4 , or via other neural architectures such as RNNs, LSTMs BID14 Collobert and Weston, 1 And, hence the title! 2008), all sharing one core idea -to map input entities to dense vector embeddings lying in a lowdimensional latent space where the semantics of the inputs are preserved.While existing methods represent each entity of interest (e.g., a word) as a single point in space (e.g., its embedding vector), we here propose a fundamentally different approach.We represent each entity based on the histogram of contexts (cooccurring with it), with the contexts themselves being points in a suitable metric space.This allows us to cast the distance between histograms associated with the entities as an instance of the optimal transport problem (Monge, 1781; Kantorovich, 1942; Villani, 2008) .For example, in the case of words as entities, the resulting framework then intuitively seeks to minimize the cost of moving the set of contexts of a given word to the contexts of another.Note that the contexts here can be words, phrases, sentences, or general entities cooccurring with our objects to be represented, and these objects further could be any type of events extracted from sequence data, including e.g., products such as movies or web-advertisements BID8 , nodes in a graph BID9 , or other entities (Wu et al., 2017) .Any co-occurrence structure will allow the construction of the histogram information, which is the crucial building block for our approach.A strong motivation for our proposed approach here comes from the domain of natural language, where the entities (words, phrases or sentences) generally have multiple semantics under which they are present.Hence, it is important that we consider representations that are able to effectively capture such inherent uncertainty and polysemy, and we will argue that histograms (or probability distributions) over embeddings allows to capture more of this information compared to point-wise embeddings alone.We will call the histogram as the distributional estimate of our object of interest, while we refer to the individual embeddings of single contexts as point estimates.Next, for the sake of clarity, we discuss the framework in the concrete use-case of text representations, when the contexts are just words, by employing the well-known Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) matrix to compute the histogram information for each word.With the power of optimal transport, we show how this framework can be of significant use for a wide variety of important tasks in NLP, including word and sentence representations as well as hypernymy (entailment) detection, and can be readily employed on top of existing pre-trained embeddings for the contexts.The connection to optimal transport at the level of words and contexts paves the way to make better use of its vast toolkit (like Wasserstein distances, barycenters, etc.) for applications in NLP, which in the past has primarily been restricted to document distances (Kusner et al., 2015; BID16 .Wedemonstrate that building the required histograms comes at almost no additional cost, as the co-occurrence counts are obtained in a single pass over the corpus. Thanksto the entropic regularization introduced by Cuturi (2013), Optimal Transport distances can be computed efficiently in a parallel and batched manner on GPUs. Lastly, the obtained transport map FIG0 ) also provides for interpretability of the suggested framework.To sum up, we advocate for associating both a distributional and point estimate as a representation for each entity.We show how this allows us to use optimal transport over the set of contexts associated with these entities, in problems with a co-occurrence structure.Further, the framework Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre.2012.Semeval-2012 In particular, when β = 1, we recover the equation for histograms as in Section 5, and β = 0 would imply normalization with respect to cluster sizes.","answer":"Represent each entity based on its histogram of contexts and then Wasserstein is all you need!"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

(2014) , points out that if the generated distribution and the target distribution are supported on manifolds where the measure of intersection is zero, Jensen-Shannon divergence will be constant and the KL divergences be infinite.Consequently, the generator fails to obtain enough useful gradient to update, which undermines GAN training.Moreover, two non-overlapping distributions may be judged to be quite different by the Jensen-Shannon divergence, even if they are nearby with high probability.As a result, to better measure the difference between two distributions, Integral Probability Metrics (IPM) based GANs have been proposed.For instance, utilizes Wasserstein distance in GAN discriminator, while Li et al. (2017) adopts maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), managing to project and discriminate data in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).To mention, the RKHS with characteristic kernels including Gaussian RBF kernel (Li et al., 2017) and rational quadratic kernel (Bińkowski et al., 2018) has strong power in the discrimination of two distributions, see e.g. (Sriperumbudur et al., 2010) .In this paper, inspired by non-linear discriminating power of decision forests, we propose a new type of kernel named random-forest kernel to improve the performance of MMD GAN discriminator.In order to fit with back-propagation training procedure, we borrow the decision forest model with stochastic and differentiable decision trees from Kontschieder et al. (2015) in our random-forest kernel.To be specific, each dimension of the GAN discriminator outputs is randomly connected to one internal node of a soft decision forest, serving as the candidate to-be-split dimension.Then, the tree is split with a soft decision function through a probabilistic routing.Other than the typical decision forest used in classification tasks where the value of each leaf node is a label, the leaf value of our random forest is the probability of a sample x i falling into a certain leaf node of the forest.If the output of the discriminator is denoted as h θ N (x i ) and the probability output of the t-th tree is denoted as µ t (h θ N (x i ); θ F ), the random forest kernel k RF can be formulated aswhere T is the total number of trees in the forest, θ N and θ F denote the parameters of the GAN discriminator and the random forest respectively.Recall that random forest and deep neural networks are first combined in Kontschieder et al. (2015) , where differentiable decision tree model and deep convolutional networks are trained together in an end-to-end manner to solve classification tasks.Then, Shen et al. (2017) extends the idea to label distribution learning, and Shen et al. (2018) makes further extensions in regression regime.Moreover, Zuo & Drummond (2017) , Zuo et al. (2018) and Avraham et al. (2019) also introduce deep decision forests.Apart from the typical ensemble method that averages the results across trees, they aggregate the results by multiplication.As for the combination of random forest and GAN, Zuo et al. (2018) introduce forests structure in GAN discriminator, combining CNN network and forest as a composited classifier, while Avraham et al. (2019) uses forest structure as one of non-linear mapping functions in regularization part.On the other hand, in the aspect of relationship between random forest and kernel method, Breiman (2000) initiates the literature concerning the link.He shows the fact that a purely random tree partition is equivalent to a kernel acting on the true margin, of which form can be viewed as the probability of two samples falling into the same terminal node.Shen & Vogelstein (2018) proves that random forest kernel is characteristic.Some more theoretical analysis can be found in Davies & Ghahramani (2014) , Arlot & Genuer (2014) , Scornet (2016) .However, despite their theoretical breakthroughs, forest decision functions used in these forest kernels are non-differentiable hard margins rather than differentiable soft ones, and thus cannot be directly used in back propagation regime.To the best of our knowledge, MMD GAN with our proposed random-forest kernel is the first to combine random forest with deep neural network in the form of kernel MMD GAN.Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of MMD GAN with our random-forest kernel.From the theoretical point of view, our random-forest kernel enjoys the property of being characteristic, and the gradient estimators used in the training process of random-forest kernel GAN are unbiased.In numerical experiments, we evaluate our random-forest kernel under the setting of both the original MMD GAN (Li et al., 2017) and the one with repulsive loss (Wang et al., 2019) .Besides, we also compare our random-forest kernel with Gaussian RBF kernel (Li et al., 2017) , rational quadratic kernel (Bińkowski et al., 2018) , and bounded RBF kernel (Wang et al., 2019) .As a result, MMD GAN with our random-forest kernel outperforms its counterparts with respect to both accuracy and training stability.This paper is organized as follows.First of all, we introduce some preliminaries of MMD GAN in Section 2.Then we review the concept of deep random forest and show how it is embedded within a CNN in 3.1.After that, random-forest kernels and MMD GAN with random-forest kernels are proposed in 3.2 and 3.3 respectively.Besides, the training techniques of MMD GAN with random-forest kernel are demonstrated in Section 3.4 and the theoretical results are shown in Section 3.5.Eventually, Section 4 presents the experimental setups and results, including the comparison between our proposed random-forest kernel and other kernels.In addition, all detailed theoretical proofs are included in the Appendices.The generative model captures the data distribution P X , by building a mapping function G : Z → X from a prior noise distribution P Z to data space.While the discriminative model D : X → R is used to distinguish generated distribution P Y from real data distribution P X .Taking X, X ∼ P X and Y, Y ∼ P Y := P G (Z) where Y := G(Z) and Y := G(Z ), the squared MMD is expressed asThe loss of generator and discriminator in MMD GAN proposed in Li et al.

In this study, we test this prediction by examining the properties and requirements of inter-Golgi transport within fused cells, which requires mobile carriers in order for exchange of constituents to occur. We report that both small soluble and membrane-bound secretory cargo and exogenous Golgi resident glycosyl-transferases are exchanged between separated Golgi. Large soluble aggregates, which traverse individual stacks, do not transfer between Golgi, implying that small cargoes( which can fit in a typical transport vesicle) are transported by a different mechanism. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that the carriers of both anterograde and retrograde cargoes are the size of COPI vesicles, contain coatomer, and functionally require ARF1 and coatomer for transport. The data suggest that COPI vesicles traffic both small secretory cargo and steady-state Golgi resident enzymes among stacked cisternae that are stationary.Introduction:The Golgi apparatus is a central feature of the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. In higher eukaryotes, the Golgi stack consists of four to six flattened cisternae, which contain a series of glycosyl-transferases and other resident membrane proteins. These are localized in the order of their function in distinct steady-state distributions along the axis between the cis( entry) and the trans( exit) face, as a result of a dynamic equilibrium resulting from a balance of anterograde( ER → cis → trans) and retrograde( trans → cis and Golgi → ER) flows. Proteins secreted from the cell, as well as constituents of the plasma membrane and a broad variety of membrane-enclosed compartments pass through the ER–Golgi system in the anterograde direction, diverging only as they depart the Golgi stack at its trans face( also termed the TGN). During this anterograde passage they are typically glycosylated in a step-wise fashion as they encounter the responsible enzymes( Emr et al., 2009; Klumperman, 2011). There are two broadly opposing alternative mechanisms( with many variations) to explain anterograde transport( cis → trans) across the Golgi( Emr et al., 2009; Rothman, 2010):( 1) mobile cisternae( also termed cisternal progression), in which the cisterna themselves move from cis → trans, being continuously remodeled by retrograde flow of resident enzymes in the process( Mironov et al., 2001; Losev et al., 2006; Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006).( 2) The vesicular transport model, in which cisterna are viewed as static and the anterograde cargo must then be mobile, moving forward from cisterna-to-cisterna by a carrier mechanism. COPI-coated vesicles are the principal candidates for anterograde carriers, as they form and fuse copiously throughout the Golgi stack, and many contain anterograde cargo( Balch et al., 1984b; Rothman and Wieland, 1996; Orci et al., 1997; Rothman, 2010). COPI vesicles are known to carry retrograde cargo from Golgi to ER( Letourneur et al., 1994; Emr et al., 2009). However, dynamic tubular connections between cisternae have also been proposed( Trucco et al., 2004). In this study, we seek to gain insight into how small anterograde( and retrograde) directed cargoes traverse stacked Golgi. We also test core predictions of the COPI vesicular model for anterograde transport among static cisternae. For these purposes we have employed a simple assay for inter-Golgi transport within fused cells, which requires mobile carriers in order for exchange of Golgi constituents to occur. Over 25 years ago, long before dynamic imaging in live cells with GFP tags was possible, we reported the surprising finding that VSV-encoded G protein is capable of rapid exchange between two different Golgi populations within fused cells( Rothman et al., 1984a, b). These results recapitulated a previous discovery made in cell-free extracts( Fries and Rothman, 1980; Balch et al., 1984a), which later allowed the identification of key vesicle transport machinery( such as coatomer, NSF, and SNAREs) needed for inter-Golgi transport( Malhotra et al., 1988; Waters et al., 1991; Serafini et al., 1991a, b). Although the data generated with this biochemical approach strongly indicated that VSV-G containing COPI vesicles were employed in anterograde transport in the Golgi( Orci et al., 1989), this interpretation was debated( Mellman and Simons, 1992; Pelham, 1994) because the role of COPI vesicles in retrograde transport was subsequently uncovered( Letourneur et al., 1994), and the then available data on inter-Golgi traffic could not rule out that Golgi glycosyl-transferases are also transported between Golgi and could contribute an unknown portion of the assay signals( Love et al., 1998; Walter et al., 1998). Other groups used a cell fusion assay to observe the behavior of fluorescently labeled Golgi markers, but were only able to do so hours after fusion had taken place, when the Golgi were already reassembled at the center of the newly-formed poly-karyons( Ho et al., 1990; Deng et al., 1992). Here, we have reinvestigated inter-Golgi transport with much more precise and penetrating tools of modern cell and molecular biology and optics, and find that both small anterograde cargo and Golgi resident glycosyl-transferases are briskly exchanged. Large soluble aggregates, which traverse the stack, do not transfer between Golgi, implying that small cargo( which can fit in a typical transport vesicle) are transported by a different mechanism. Super-resolution microscopy and live cell imaging reveal that the carriers of both anterograde and retrograde cargo are the size of COPI vesicles, contain coatomer, and are Arf1-dependent.Discussion:This report describes a study specifically intended to test the predictions of the vesicular transport model. Our reasoning was that only mobile carriers, such as COPI vesicles, should be able to travel the long distance between well-separated Golgi of fused cells. Our results clearly establish that only small cargoes( anterograde or resident proteins) are exchanged, showing that inter-Golgi carriers are capable of size-filtration, and that small cargo transport must utilize a distributive mechanism different from the mechanism used by large soluble aggregates. More than half of the carriers exclusively contained anterograde cargo, suggesting sub-populations of COPI vesicles as previously documented by immuno-EM( Orci et al., 1997). Because the imaged carriers contained coatomer, are indistinguishable in size from authentic COPI vesicles, and require both coatomer and ARF1 to function, the simplest interpretation is that the bulk of inter-Golgi transport of small cargo is mediated by COPI vesicles. Certainly, the double photo-bleaching experiments show that the bulk of the cargo flux between Golgi is mediated by fluorescent ‘dots’ that function as carriers. However, we cannot strictly rule out that the genetic effects of ARF1 and ε−COP mutations on inter-Golgi transport are somehow an indirect coincidence or that the carrier is some kind of very short tubule that is partially coated and capable of fission( at one Golgi) and fusion( at another). Correlative electron microscope imaging of the fluorescent dots, including immunolabeling of coatomer, would theoretically be needed to address this distinction, which is probably semantic in any case since many COPI vesicles have uncoated portions( Faini et al., 2012). Because the dots/COPI vesicles are highly dilute in cytoplasm, the rarity of finding such vesicles in single EM sections together with the inherent inefficiency of immunolabeling at the EM level, makes such an effort quixotic at best. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that exogenous glycosyltransferases exceed the capacity of the Golgi retention machinery and thus begin to behave like soluble cargoes, the relative abundance of COPI containing carriers harboring Golgi resident glycosyltransferase( ∼40% of the total) suggests that these proteins are engaged in a dynamic equilibrium of anterograde and retrograde flow to maintain their differential steady-state cis-trans distributions. Their presence in transport vesicles is a required feature of the mobile cisterna model, as incorporated in the concept of cisternal ‘maturation’( Glick and Malhotra, 1998), but may also be important for establishing and maintaining their cis-trans distributions by bi-directional transport( Pelham and Rothman, 2000) among static cisternae. We note that previous reports on the prevalence of glycosyl-transferases in COPI vesicles have yielded variable results( Orci et al., 2000; Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001; Cosson et al., 2002). The present results naturally suggest that transport of small cargo is bi-directional and mediated by COPI-coated vesicles. The data suggest that COPI vesicles traffic both secretory cargo and steady-state Golgi resident enzymes among stacked cisternae that are stationary over many hours in non-dividing cells. Further, they suggest that large soluble cargo are transported across the Golgi by a specialized mechanism that involves carriers which remain closely linked to the stack as the progress across it. While these inferences are as strong as current imaging technology permits, super-resolution methods are rapidly advancing and it will be important to further test these models as it becomes possible to visualize the content and movements of individual carriers in real time in living cells.","answer":"All eukaryotic cells contain an organelle called the Golgi apparatus , which consists of a series of four to six flattened structures called cisternae . Proteins that are intended for secretion from the cell , or proteins that go on to become part of the cell membrane , must pass through the Golgi , where they undergo modifications that ensure they are targeted to the correct place . There are two main models for how proteins are transported from the entry side of the Golgi , known as the cis face , to the exit side ( trans face ) , through a process known as anterograde transport . One possibility is that the cargo protein matures within a single cisterna , which gradually moves from the cis to the trans face without the protein ever leaving it . Alternatively , the cisternae may remain fixed in position , while individual proteins are carried between them by specialized transport vesicles called COPI vesicles . Now , Pellett et al . have used modern molecular biology techniques to revisit this question , more than 25 years after members of the same group first obtained evidence suggesting the involvement of COPI vesicles . To do this , they labelled the proteins that reside within the Golgi of one cell green , and those within the Golgi of another cell , red . They then fused the two cells together , and traced the movement of labelled proteins between the two organelles . Proteins that are known to undergo anterograde transport were also transported between the two Golgi , whereas large protein aggregates were not . Super-resolution microscopy revealed that the transported proteins were carried in vesicles the size of COPI vesicles and surrounded by a coat protein that resembles COPI . Moreover , transport involved the adaptor protein ARF , which helps to load cargo into COPI vesicles . By providing evidence that Golgi resident proteins and proteins that normally undergo anterograde transport can be carried by COPI vesicles between two physically separate Golgi , Pellett et al . increase the weight of evidence that COPI vesicles may also be responsible for both retrograde and anterograde transport within the Golgi itself ."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Since data is severely limited, we work under the assumption that a classifier should have a very simple inductive bias. Our approach, prototypical networks, is based on the idea that there exists an embedding in which points cluster around a single prototype representation for each class. In order to do this, we learn a non-linear mapping of the input into an embedding space using a neural network and take a class’s prototype to be the mean of its support set in the embedding space. Classification is then performed for an embedded query point by simply finding the nearest class prototype. We follow the same approach to tackle zero-shot learning; here each class comes with meta-data giving a high-level description of the class rather than a small number of labeled examples. We therefore learn an embedding of the meta-data into a shared space to serve as the prototype for each class. Classification is performed, as in the few-shot scenario, by finding the nearest class prototype for an embedded query point. Prototypical networks compute an M-dimensional representation mathbf{c}_{k}inmathbb{R}^{M}, or prototype, of each class through an embedding function f_{bm{phi}}:mathbb{R}^{D}rightarrowmathbb{R}^{M} with learnable parameters bm{phi}. Each prototype is the mean vector of the embedded support points belonging to its class:mathbf{c}_{k}=frac{1}{|S_{k}|}sum_{(mathbf{x}_{i},y_{i})in S_{k}}f_{bm{phi}}(mathbf{x}_{i})(1)Given a distance function d:mathbb{R}^{M}timesmathbb{R}^{M}rightarrow[0,+infty), prototypical networks produce a distribution over classes for a query point mathbf{x} based on a softmax over distances to the prototypes in the embedding space:p_{bm{phi}}(y=k,|,mathbf{x})=frac{exp(-d(f_{bm{phi}}(mathbf{x}),mathbf{c}_{k}))}{sum_{k^{prime}}exp(-d(f_{bm{phi}}(mathbf{x}),mathbf{c}_{k^{prime}}))}(2)Learning proceeds by minimizing the negative log-probability J(bm{phi})=-log p_{bm{phi}}(y=k,|,mathbf{x}) of the true class k via SGD. Training episodes are formed by randomly selecting a subset of classes from the training set, then choosing a subset of examples within each class to act as the support set and a subset of the remainder to serve as query points.

This study aim ed to investigate the diffusional properties of the CST in patients with iNPH by using DTI and to determine whether this method could be used as a new diagnostic tool to differentiate patients with iNPH from those with AD and PDD and control subjects . MATERIAL S AND METHODS : We enrolled 18 patients with iNPH , 11 patients with AD , 11 patients with PDD , and 19 healthy control subjects .  Diffusion tensor metrics of the segmented CST , including FA values , axial eigenvalues , and radial eigenvalues , were evaluated by using tract-specific analysis . The anisotropy color-coding tractography of the CST was visually evaluated . The DTI findings were compared among groups . RESULTS : Tract-specific analysis of the CST showed that FA values and axial eigenvalues were significantly increased ( P < .001 ) , whereas radial eigenvalues were not significantly altered , in patients with iNPH compared with other subjects . The CST tractographic images in patients with iNPH was visually different from those in other subjects ( P < .001 ) . In discriminating patients with iNPH from other subjects , the CST FA values had a sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 80 % at a cutoff value of 0.59 . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that patients with iNPH have altered microstructures in the CST . Quantitative and visual CST evaluation by using DTI may be useful for differentiating patients with iNPH from patients with AD or PDD or healthy subjectsTitle 2:Patterns of fractional anisotropy changes in white matter of cerebellar peduncles distinguish spinocerebellar ataxia-1 from multiple system atrophy and other ataxia syndromesAbstract 2:AIM To determine prospect ively if qualitative and quantitative diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) metrics of white matter integrity are better than conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) metrics for discriminating cerebellar diseases . METHODS Conventional MRI images from 31 consecutive patients with ataxia and 12 controls were interpreted by a neuroradiologist given only a clinical indication of ataxia . An expert ataxologist , blinded to radiological findings , determined the clinical diagnosis , as well as ataxia severity and asymmetry for each patient . For qualitative analysis , a comparison of the cerebellar white matter in ataxic vs. control patients was made by visual inspection of directionally encoded color ( DEC ) images . For quantitative analysis , segmentation of the cerebellar white matter in the inferior , middle , and superior cerebellar peduncles ( ICP , MCP , and SCP ) was attempted using three methods : a region of interest method , a deterministic DTI tractography ( DDT ) method , and a probabilistic DTI tractography ( PDT ) method . A statistical comparison of the average fractional anisotropy ( FA ) in these tracts was made between subject groups , and correlated to clinical diagnosis , severity , and asymmetry . RESULTS Of the 31 consecutive patients with ataxia , the two largest subgroups had a clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy ( cerebellar subtype ; MSA-C ) , and spinocerebellar ataxia-1 ( SCA1 ) . Conventional MRI features , such as degree of pontocerebellar atrophy , correlated with ataxia severity , but were neither sensitive nor specific for the ataxia subtypes . PDT was the most accurate and least variable method of the three methods used for determining FA , especially in the ICP . Average FA in all ataxic patients was significantly decreased in the MCP , SCP and ICP and this decrease correlated to disease severity . Asymmetric ataxia correlated to proportionately larger contralateral MCP , ICP and SCP FA values . MCP , ICP , and SCP FA difference values formed distinct clusters that distinguished MSA-C from SCA-1 , and other ataxia syndromes . CONCLUSIONS Qualitative and quantitative reductions in DTI metrics of white matter integrity in the cerebellar peduncles correlated better to clinical features of patients with sporadic and hereditary ataxias than conventional structural MRI measures of pontocerebellar atrophyTitle 3:Case control study of diffusion tensor imaging in Parkinson’s diseaseAbstract 3:Background : Preliminary work has shown that diffusion tensor MRI ( DTI ) may contribute to the diagnosis of Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) . Objectives : We conducted a large , prospect i ve , case control study to determine : ( 1 ) if fractional anisotropy ( FA ) and apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) values on DTI in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra are different between patients with PD and healthy controls ; and ( 2 ) the predictive value of these parameters and their clinical utility . Methods : DTI imaging was carried out in patients with PD and controls .  FA and ADC values were obtained from various brain structures on the DTI scan using the diffusion tensor taskcard . The structures studied were : cau date , putamen , globus pallidus , thalamus and substantia nigra . Results : 151 subjects ( 73 PD patients , 41 men , 32 women ; mean age 63.6 years ) and 78 age and sex matched control subjects were studied . The FA value of the substantia nigra in patients with PD was lower compared with controls ( 0.403 vs 0.415 ; p = 0.001 ) . However , no significant differences were demonstrated for FA or ADC values of other structures . Multiple regression analysis revealed that the clinical severity of PD correlated inversely with the FA value in the substantia nigra in patients with PD ( regression coefficient −0.019 ) . No single FA value had both a high positive and negative predictive power for PD . Conclusions : We demonstrated in a large , prospect i ve , case control study that the FA value in the substantia nigra on DTI was lower in PD compared with healthy controls , and correlated inversely with the clinical severity of PD . Further longitudinal studies would be helpful to assess the clinical utility of serial FA measurements of the substantia nigra in objective quantification of disease progression and monitoring of the therapeutic responseTitle 4:Usefulness of combined fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient values for detection of involvement in multiple system atrophyAbstract 4:Objective : To determine whether apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) values and fractional anisotropy ( FA ) values can detect early pathological involvement in multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , and be used to differentiate MSA-P ( multiple system atrophy if parkinsonian features predominate ) from Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) . Methods : We compared  ADC and FA  values in the pons , cerebellum and putamen of 61 subjects ( 20 probable MSA patients , 21 age matched PD patients and 20 age matched healthy controls ) using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance system . Results : ADC values in the pons , cerebellum and putamen were significantly higher , and FA values lower in MSA than in PD or controls . These differences were prominent in MSA lacking dorsolateral putaminal hyperintensity ( DPH ) or hot cross bun ( HCB ) sign . In differentiating MSA-P from PD using FA and ADC values , we obtained equal sensitivity ( 70 % ) and higher specificity ( 100 % ) in the pons than in the putamen and cerebellum . In addition , all patients that had both significant low FA and high ADC values in each of these three areas were MSA-P cases , and those that had both normal FA and ADC values in the pons were all PD cases . Our diagnostic algorithm based on these results accurately diagnosed 90 % of patients with MSA-P. Conclusion : FA and ADC values detected early pathological involvement prior to magnetic resonance signal changes in MSA . In particular , low FA values in the pons showed high specificity in discriminating MSA-P from PD . In addition , combined analysis of both FA and ADC values in all three areas was more useful than only oneTitle 5:Diffusion tensor analysis of corpus callosum in progressive supranuclear palsyAbstract 5:Introduction Progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) is a neurodegenerative disease featuring parkinsonism , supranuclear ophthalmoplegia , dysphagia , and frontal lobe dysfunction . The corpus callosum which consists of many commissure fibers probably reflects cerebral cortical function . Several previous reports showed atrophy or diffusion abnormalities of anterior corpus callosum in PSP patients , but partitioning method used in these studies was based on data obtained in nonhuman primates . In this study , we performed a diffusion tensor analysis using a new partitioning method for the human corpus callosum . Methods Seven consecutive patients with PSP were compared with 29 age-matched patients with Parkinson ’s Disease ( PD ) and 19 age-matched healthy control subjects . All subjects underwent  diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging , and the corpus callosum was partitioned into five areas on the mid-sagittal plane according to a recently established topography of human corpus callosum ( CC1—prefrontal area , CC2—premotor and supplementary motor area , CC3—motor area , CC4—sensory area , CC5—parietal , temporal , and occipital area ) . Fractional anisotropy ( FA ) and apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) were measured in each area and differences between groups were analyzed . Results In the PSP group , FA values were significantly decreased in CC1 and CC2 , and ADC values were significantly increased in CC1 and CC2 . Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed excellent reliability of FA and ADC analyses of CC1 for differentiating PSP from PD . Conclusion The anterior corpus callosum corresponding to the prefrontal , premotor , and supplementary motor cortices is affected in PSP patients .

RSZ breakage, however, required genes encoding condensin subunits (YCG1, YSC4) and topoisomerase II (TOP2).BGLF4 also stimulates the decatenation activity of topoisomerase II, suggesting that it may induce chromosome condensation through condensin and topoisomerase II activation.BGLF4 interacts with condensin complexes, the major components in mitotic chromosome assembly, and induces condensin phosphorylation at Cdc2 consensus motifs.Condensin-dependent localisation of topoisomerase II to an axial chromosomal structure is required for sister chromatid resolution during mitosis.condensin is required so that an axial chromatid structure can be organised where topoisomerase II can effectively promote sister chromatid resolution.","answer":"Condensin prevents deleterious anaphase bridges during chromosome segregation by promoting sister chromatid decatenation. aids sister chromatid decatenation by topoisomerase II Condensin prevents deleterious anaphase bridges during chromosome segregation by promoting sister chromatid decatenation which are created by topoisomerase II.

Germline mutations in the RB1 gene confer hereditary predisposition to retinoblastoma. We have performed a mutation survey of the RB1 gene in 232 patients with hereditary or non hereditary retinoblastoma. We systematically explored all 27 exons and flanking sequences as well as the promotor. All types of point mutations are represented and are found unequally distributed along the RB1 gene sequence. In the population we studied, exons 3, 8, 18 and 19 are preferentially altered. The range of frequency of detection of germline mutations is about 20%, indicating that other mechanisms of inactivation of RB1 should be involved. The spectrum of mutations presented here should help to improve the clinical management of retinoblastoma and to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"hereditary or non hereditary retinoblastoma\\", \\"hereditary and non hereditary retinoblastoma\\", \\"retinoblastoma\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Here, the paracrine role of extracellular vesicles( EVs) in bone healing was investigated. First, purified human perivascular stem cells( PSCs) were observed to induce mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects on osteoprogenitor cells while in non-contact co-culture via elaboration of EVs. PSC-derived EVs shared mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic properties of their parent cell. PSC-EV effects were dependent on surface-associated tetraspanins, as demonstrated by EV trypsinization, or neutralizing antibodies for CD9 or CD81. Moreover, shRNA knockdown in recipient cells demonstrated requirement for the CD9/CD81 binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN for EV bioactivity. Finally, PSC-EVs stimulated bone repair, and did so via stimulation of skeletal cell proliferation, migration, and osteodifferentiation. In sum, PSC-EVs mediate the same tissue repair effects of perivascular stem cells, and represent an ‘off-the-shelf’ alternative for bone tissue regeneration.Introduction:Stromal progenitor cells within vessel walls have multipotent properties( Cathery et al., 2018; Corselli et al., 2012; Covas et al., 2008; Crisan et al., 2008; Dellavalle et al., 2007; Farrington-Rock et al., 2004), are native forerunners of mesenchymal stem cells( MSCs), and participate in endogenous bone repair( Diaz-Flores et al., 1991; Diaz-Flores et al., 1992; Grcevic et al., 2012). When purified based on expression of CD146( Mel-CAM) and CD34, human perivascular stem cells( PSCs) from adipose tissue or other tissue compartments speed bone repair( Askarinam et al., 2013; Chung et al., 2014; James et al., 2017a; James et al., 2012a; James et al., 2012b; Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016). Although direct incorporation of human PSCs into chondroblasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes occurs( James et al., 2012b), PSCs induce bone healing either primarily or exclusively via paracrine stimulation of the resident host cells within the defect niche( Chung et al., 2014; Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016). High expression and secretion of osteoinductive proteins has been observed among freshly sorted or culture-expanded PSCs, including bone morphogenetic proteins( BMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor( VEGF) among others( Chen et al., 2009; Hardy et al., 2017; James et al., 2017b). However, the exact paracrine intermediaries of PSC-induced bone defect healing are not known. Extracellular vesicles( EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, carry a repertoire of bioactive molecules: proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates( Colombo et al., 2014; Cvjetkovic et al., 2016; Mateescu et al., 2017). The heterogenous nature of EVs is well described, with EVs of a diameter <100–150 nm and multivesicular body( MVB) origin termed exosomes( Gould and Raposo, 2013; Mateescu et al., 2017). Stromal progenitor cells elaborate EVs, and EVs have been observed to harbor many of the regenerative properties of their parent cell( Lakhter and Sims, 2015). In bone repair, CD9 knockout mice, which have impaired EV elaboration, have delayed appendicular bone healing, that may be rescued by mesenchymal progenitor cell-derived EVs( Furuta et al., 2016). As well, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived EVs have been shown to incite osteogenesis and vasculogenesis in vivo( Qin et al., 2016; Todorova et al., 2017). The potential role of miRNA cargo in EVs has been implicated in these effects, however the mechanisms that underlie EV-mediated reparative effects in bone are essentially unknown. Here, we observe that in similarity to their parent cell, PSC-derived EVs incite pleiotropic effects on skeletal progenitor cells, including mitogenic, pro-migratory, pro-osteogenic effects, and broad ranging changes in the cellular transcriptome of the recipient cell. These bioactive effects require EV tetraspanin activity, as well as expression of their binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN by the recipient progenitor cell. These cellular effects of PSC-EVs on skeletal progenitor cells converge to incite intramembranous bone repair in a mouse model.Discussion:In sum, perivascular EVs induce proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells, and the confluence of these effects positively regulates bone defect repair. Perivascular EVs require surface-associated tetraspanins for bioactivity, and recipient skeletal cells require their binding partners to respond to a perivascular EV stimulus. These data solidify the pleiotropic paracrine effects of perivascular stem cells on bone repair, and suggest the importance of perivascular EVs in both endogenous bone repair as well as in skeletal tissue engineering. Future studies must consider the issues of process optimization, including the optimum method for PSC-EV isolation, storage, and sustained delivery.","answer":"Throughout our lives , our bodies need to heal after injury . Blood vessels are found throughout the body’s tissues and are a source of cells that guide the process of repair . These cells , called perivascular stem cells ( PSCs ) , are a type of stem cell found in the lining of blood vessels . Stem cells are cells that can become one of several different types of mature cells , depending on what the body needs . Extracellular vesicles are bundles of chemical signals that cells send into their external environment . Just like an address or a tag on a parcel , specific molecules mark the exterior surface of these bundles to deliver the message to the right recipient . Stem cells often use extracellular vesicles to communicate with surrounding cells . One role of PSCs is repairing damage to bones . Unusually , they do not turn into new bone cells and so do not directly contribute to the re-growing tissue . Instead , PSCs act indirectly , by stimulating the cells around them . How PSCs send these ‘repair instructions’ has , however , remained unclear . Xu et al . wanted to determine if PSCs used extracellular vesicles to direct bone repair , and if so , what ‘tags’ needed to be on the vesicles and on the receiving cells for this to happen . Experiments using PSCs and immature bone cells grown in the laboratory allowed the PSCs’ effect on bone cells to be simulated in a Petri dish . The two types of cells were grown on either side of a barrier , which separated them physically but allowed chemical signals through . In response to the PSCs , the immature bone cells multiplied , started to move ( which is something they need to do to heal damaged tissue ) , and began to resemble mature bone cells . Analysis of the signals released by the PSCs revealed that these were indeed extracellular vesicles , and that they were tagged by specific proteins called tetraspanins . Genetic manipulation of the immature bone cells later showed that these cells needed specific ‘receiver’ molecules to respond to the PSCs . Adding only extracellular vesicles to the bone cells , without any PSCs , confirmed that it was indeed the vesicles that triggered the healing response . Finally , giving the vesicles to mice with bone damage helped them to heal faster than untreated animals . These results have uncovered a key mechanism by which stem cells control the repair of bone tissue . This could one day lead to better treatments for patients recovering from fractures or needing bone surgery ."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

The results showed that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited nanomolar potency against CEase, much better than the parent flavonoids. Furthermore, these phosphorylated flavonoids demonstrated good to high selectivity for CEase over AChE, which only showed micromolar potency inhibition of AChE. The most selective and potent inhibitor of CEase (3e) had IC50 value of 0.72 nM and 11800-fold selectivity for CEase over AChE. The structure-activity relationships revealed that the free hydroxyl group at position 5 and phosphate group at position 7 of the phosphorylated flavonoids are favorable to the inhibition of CEase.

METHODS: In a randomised double-blind study, 24 male patients received a 5-h infusion of propofol at the rate of 1 mg/kg/h for sedation in the immediate postoperative period following coronary artery bypass surgeryPropofol infusion and oxycodone-thiopental bolus dosages, titrated to the same sedation end point, resulted in similar time from admission to extubation, although the weaning period was shorter in the propofol group. In terms of breathing pattern, gas exchange, blood gases and haemodynamics, the methods were similar. Propofol, despite its attractive pharmacological profile, may offer no clinical benefit in short-term sedation after a moderate dose fentanyl anaesthesia in cardiac surgery.Postoperative short-term sedation with propofol in cardiac surgery.We conducted a randomized double-blind study to assess the safety and effectiveness of short-term sedation with propofol in adult patients immediately after cardiac surgery.The use of propofol for short-term sedation in ICUs has allowed the maintenance of sedation to continue until just a few hours before extubation but the benefits of propofol for longer-term indications are more debatable.Midazolam and propofol are available as hypnotics for short-term sedation during the post-operative period.The use of midazolam versus propofol for short-term sedation following coronary artery bypass grafting.Midazolam and propofol were compared in an open randomized study for postoperative sedation during 12 h of mechanical ventilation in 40 patients following coronary artery bypass graftingPropofol is a known anesthetic agent, widely used for short-term anesthesia and for longer-term sedation.Propofol was the most commonly used agent overall during the observational period (primarily for short-term and intermediate-length sedation); midazolam was the most commonly used for long-term sedation.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

With recent advances in computer vision and mobile computing, AR has scaled across platforms, and has increased adoption in major products. One of the key challenges in enabling AR features is proper anchoring of the virtual content to the real world, a process referred to as tracking. In this paper, we present a system for motion tracking, which is capable of robustly tracking planar targets and performing relative-scale 6DoF tracking without calibration. Our system runs in real-time on mobile phones and has been deployed in multiple major products on hundreds of millions of devices.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We present an approach to real-time tracking and mapping that supports any type of camera motion in 3D environments, that is, general (parallax-inducing) as well as rotation-only (degenerate) motions. Our approach effectively generalizes both a panorama mapping and tracking system and a keyframe-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system, behaving like one or the other depending on the camera movement. It seamlessly switches between the two and is thus able to track and map through arbitrary sequences of general and rotation-only camera movements.[2]: Accurately estimating a robot's pose relative to a global scene model and precisely tracking the pose in real-time is a fundamental problem for navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks. Due to the computational complexity of localization against a large map and the memory consumed by the model, state-of-the-art approaches are either limited to small workspaces or rely on a server-side system to query the global model while tracking the pose locally. The latter approaches face the problem of smoothly integrating the server's pose estimates into the trajectory computed locally to avoid temporal discontinuities. In this paper, we demonstrate that large-scale, real-time pose estimation and tracking can be performed on mobile platforms with limited resources without the use of an external server. This is achieved by employing map and descriptor compression schemes as well as efficient search algorithms from computer vision. We derive a formulation for integrating the global pose information into a local state estimator that produces much smoother trajectories than current approaches. Through detailed experiments, we evaluate each of our design choices individually and document its impact on the overall system performance, demonstrating that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for localization at scale.[3]: [4]: [5]: Planar object tracking is an actively studied problem in vision-based robotic applications. While several benchmarks have been constructed for evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms, there is a lack of video sequences captured in the wild rather than in constrained laboratory environment. In this paper, we present a carefully designed planar object tracking benchmark containing 210 videos of 30 planar objects sampled in the natural environment. In particular, for each object, we shoot seven videos involving various challenging factors, namely scale change, rotation, perspective distortion, motion blur, occlusion, out-of-view, and unconstrained. The ground truth is carefully annotated semi-manually to ensure the quality. Moreover, eleven state-of-the-art algorithms are evaluated on the benchmark using two evaluation metrics, with detailed analysis provided for the evaluation results. We expect the proposed benchmark to benefit future studies on planar object tracking.[6]: We present a real-time camera pose tracking and mapping system which uses the assumption of a planar scene to implement a highly efficient mapping algorithm. Our light-weight mapping approach is based on keyframes and plane-induced homographies between them. We solve the planar reconstruction problem of estimating the keyframe poses with an efficient image rectification algorithm. Camera pose tracking uses continuously extended and refined planar point maps and delivers robustly estimated 6DOF poses. We compare system and method with bundle adjustment and monocular SLAM on synthetic and indoor image sequences. We demonstrate large savings in computational effort compared to the monocular SLAM system while the reduction in accuracy remains acceptable.","answer":"In [6] , the authors propose a homography-based planar detection and tracking algorithm to estimate 6DoF camera poses.

While bacterial and parasitic gastrointestinal infections are declining as a result of proper disposal of sewage and safe drinking water, viral gastroenteritis is not declining in developing countries [2] . In the developed world, viruses are already the most common pathogens causing diarrhea [3] . Although viruses infecting humans had already been described since 1901 [4] and viruses were suspected to play a role in diarrhea, it lasted until 1972, when the first virus causing gastroenteritis (norovirus) was identified in an outbreak of diarrhea in Norwalk (California, United States) [5] . Shortly after the discovery of norovirus several other viruses causing gastroenteritis were discovered: rotavirus in epithelial cells of children with gastroenteritis [6] , astrovirus in infantile diarrhea cases [7] , enteric adenoviruses in the feces of children with acute diarrhea [8] , and sapovirus during an outbreak of gastroenteritis in an orphanage in Sapporo, Japan [9] . All these viruses spread via the fecal-oral route through person-to-person transmission and are described in more detail below. Noroviruses are part of the family Caliciviridae and outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis have been reported in cruise ships, health care settings, schools, and in the military, but norovirus is also responsible for around 60% of all sporadic diarrhea cases (diarrhea cases where an enteropathogen could be found), reviewed in the literature [10, 11] . The pathogenesis of norovirus infection has been tested in vivo. Filtrated norovirus was given to healthy volunteers after which most of them developed diarrhea [12] . Culturing of the virus, however, has been a problem since its discovery, yet one study has recently described the cultivation of norovirus in B cells, and has revealed that co-factors, such as histo-blood antigen expressing enteric bacteria, are probably needed before enteric viruses can be cultured in vitro [13] . Sapoviruses are also members of the Caliciviridae. There are five human genogroups of sapovirus described [14] which account for 2.2%-12.7% of all gastroenteritis cases around the globe [14, 15] . Sapovirus outbreaks occur throughout the year and can be foodborne [16] . For sapoviruses it has been described that the virus was not found before onset of an outbreak, and that it was found in 95% of the patients during an outbreak, while it declined to 50% after an outbreak, indicating that the virus introduces disease in a naturally infected host [17] . Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis among children; however, parents of infected children also often become ill and as a result rotavirus is the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in adults [18] . Studies in human volunteers have shown that infection with rotavirus causes diarrhea, results in shedding of the virus and a rise in antibody anti-virus titer after infection [19] . Additionally, astroviruses infections are common, accounting for about 10% of all sporadic diarrhea cases [20] . Astrovirus has been isolated from diseased people, filtrated and administered to healthy individuals after which in some of the volunteers diarrheal disease was observed and astrovirus was shed in their stools [21] . The virus can replicate in human embryonic kidney cells and was detected by electron microscopy (EM) [21] . Adenoviruses are responsible for around 1.5%-5.4% of the diarrhea cases in children under the age of 2 years, reviewed in the literature [22] . Of the 57 identified adenovirus types [23] , only adenoviruses type 40 and 41 are associated with diarrhea [24] . Next to these two types, adenovirus type 52 can also cause gastroenteritis [25] , although it has been argued whether type 52 is actually a separate type since there is not sufficient distance to adenovirus type 41 [26] . Adenoviruses can generally be propagated in cell lines; however, enteric adenovirus 40/41 are difficult to culture, reviewed in the literature [27] . In the 1980s and 1990s some viral agents were identified for which the direct association with disease is less clear. Aichi viruses are members of the Picornaviridae identified in fecal samples of patients with gastroenteritis [28] . Aichi virus infection has been shown to elicit an immune response [29] . Since their discovery, two case-control studies were performed, but, although both studies only found Aichi virus in stools of diarrheic patients, the prevalence of Aichi virus (0.5% and 1.8%) was too low to find a significant association with diarrhea [30, 31] . In immuno-compromised hosts the virus is found in higher quantities and is not associated with diarrhea [32] . Toroviruses, part of the Coronaviridae, were first identified in 1984 in stools of children and adults with gastroenteritis [33] . Torovirus infection is associated with diarrhea [34] and is more frequently observed in immuno-compromised patients and in nosocomial infected individuals [34] . Retrospective analysis of nosocomial viral gastroenteritis in a pediatric hospital revealed that in 67% of the cases torovirus could be detected [35] . However, only a limited number of studies report the detection of torovirus and therefore the true pathogenesis and prevalence of this virus remains elusive. Picobirnaviruses belong to the Picobirnaviridae and were first detected in the feces of children with gastroenteritis [36] . Since the initial discovery, the virus has been detected in fecal samples of several animal species, and it has been shown that the viruses are genetically highly diverse without a clear species clustering, reviewed in the literature [37] . This high sequence diversity has also been observed within particular outbreaks of gastroenteritis [38, 39] , limiting the likelihood that picobirnaviruses are actually causing outbreaks, as no distinct single source of infection can be identified. In 1907 the first tissue culture system was developed which was regarded as the golden standard for virus detection for a long time, reviewed in the literature [40] . In the 1930's serology and electron microscopy were introduced which boosted the discovery of new viruses. During these years, these methods developed fruitfully but viruses infecting the gastrointestinal tract were especially difficult to culture. Throughout the last several decades, several DNA-based techniques have been developed for virus discovery that boosted the identification of novel viruses in stool samples. The four most used methods are: 1. Universal primer-PCR [41] ; 2. Random priming-based PCR [42] ; 3. Virus Discovery cDNA, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (VIDISCA) [43] ; and 4. Sequence-Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) [44] . Universal primer-PCR is a virus discovery technique that uses universal primers designed on conserved parts of a specific viral family, which can be used to detect novel variants of this viral family. Random priming-based PCR is a technique that randomly amplifies all nucleic acids present in samples, after which the resulting PCR products can be cloned and sequenced. SISPA and VIDISCA are virus discovery techniques that are based on digestion with restriction enzymes, after which adaptors can be ligated. These methods have been successful in the discovery of novel viruses, but there are some limitations. Universal primers are useful for discovering novel viruses of a chosen family, but the primers, based on our present knowledge of the viral family, may not fit on all unknown variants. Random priming PCR, SISPA and VIDISCA are sequence independent amplification techniques. The disadvantage of random priming PCR, SISPA and VIDISCA is that the virus needs to be present at a high concentration, while the host background DNA and/or RNA should be minimal and preferably not complex. In recent years, sequence independent amplification techniques improved considerably by coupling these techniques to next-generation sequencing platforms and as a result several novel viruses have been described in gastroenteritis cases, such as cosavirus [45] , Saffold virus [46] , klassevirus/salivirus [47, 48] , polyomavirus [49] , bufavirus [50] , tusavirus [51] , and recovirus [52] . Although these viruses are found in individuals with diarrhea, for most of them the degree of circulation (prevalence) and the ability to cause morbid conditions or disease (pathogenesis) remains to be determined, as described below (also see Table 1 ). Only found in low prevalence; : Only limited data is available about this virus; *: Antibodies against astrovirus HMO-C were observed whereas no antibodies against astrovirus HMO-A were found (HMO = human-mink-ovine-like astrovirus); -No published data available;ˆPicobirnavirus, tusavirus and recovirus were identified in the gastrointestinal tract after next-generation sequencing, but no information regarding antibody response or association with diarrhea is available. In the last decade, two novel clades of astroviruses have been discovered in stool samples from patients with diarrhea that are genetically far distinct from the classical astroviruses. The first clade consists of the VA-1, VA-2, VA-3, VA-4, and VA-5 astroviruses, which are genetically related to feline and porcine astroviruses, while the second clade consists of the MLB1, MLB2 and MLB3 astroviruses and form a separate cluster [55, 57, [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] . For these novel clades the pathogenesis remains to be determined since the viruses have been identified in patients with and without diarrhea, and in some studies the viruses were associated with diarrhea whilst in others no association could be found [55] [56] [57] . In addition an antibody response was observed against some but not all novel astrovirus types [54, 58] . Recently, astrovirus MLB2 has also been detected in blood plasma of a febrile child [79] and astrovirus VA1 in a frontal cortex biopsy specimen from a patient with encephalitis [80] , suggesting that astrovirus infection may not be limited to the gastrointestinal tract. In 2008, Saffold virus was detected in a stool sample from a pediatric patient with fever of unknown origin [46] . Although Saffold virus type 3 was cultured on a human epithelial cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell line, cytopathic effects were observed and neutralizing antibodies have been found in serum samples [59] , subsequent case-control studies showed that the virus was not significantly associated with diarrhea [53, 60, 61] . Additionally, in 2008 cosavirus was identified in a patient with diarrhea [45] . However, a case-control study showed that this virus was also detected in a substantial amount of individuals without diarrhea and is not associated with diarrhea [32, 62, 63] . Klassevirus/salivirus was identified in 2009 in two fecal samples from infants with gastrointestinal disorders [47, 48] . In two studies the detection of this virus was associated with diarrhea [48, 53] , while in another study no association with disease was found [65] . Serological evidence of human klassevirus infection was obtained, suggesting that the virus infects human cells [64] . With the use of next-generation sequencing techniques, three novel polyomaviruses were also identified in human fecal samples. MW polyomavirus was identified in the stool of a healthy child from Malawi in 2012 [49] , and in the same year MX polyomavirus was found in stool samples of patients with and without diarrhea from Mexico, United States and Chili [68] . One year later, STL polyomavirus was found in the stool of a healthy child from Malawi [71] . An antibody response against MX polyomavirus [66] and MW polyomavirus [69] was observed, although MW polyomavirus [67] and STL polyomavirus [70] were not significantly associated with diarrhea in two independent case-control studies. Bufavirus is a member of the Parvoviridae and was first described in 2012 [50] . Two case-controls in Thailand and in Turkey showed that the virus was only found in patients with diarrhea and not in controls [72, 73] ; however, because of the low prevalence (respectively 0.3% in Thailand and 1.4% in Turkey), no significant association with disease was found. Tusavirus, another recently described member of the Parvoviridae, was identified in the feces of a child from Tunisia with unexplained diarrhea [51] , and thus far this is the only study describing this virus. Recovirus is a novel member of the Caliciviridae and was found in diarrhea samples from Bangladesh [52] . Similar to tusavirus, this is the only study describing this virus thus far. The identification of the above-mentioned novel viruses certainly increased our knowledge about viruses that can be found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, yet it is unknown how many of these novel viruses are actually enteropathogens. Human stool contains a wide variety of viruses which can be derived from different hosts: Besides genuine human viruses, plant dietary viruses [32, 81] and animal dietary viruses [82] can also be found in human stool, as well as bacteriophages and viruses infecting protozoa [32] . Even viruses derived from other parts of the body can be found in fecal samples, such as the John Cunningham Polyoma virus originating from the kidney ending up in feces via urine [83] , and rhinoviruses [84] , bocaviruses [85] and coronaviruses [86] originating from the respiratory tract and probably swallowed. Furthermore, viruses infecting blood cells such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 can also be detected in fecal samples [87] . Therefore, once a novel virus has been identified in human stool samples it is does not indicate that this virus is replicating in human intestinal cells. Koch recognized as early as 1891 that associating the presence of a certain agent with a certain disease is complex, and he therefore postulated guidelines that should be followed before an agent can be classified as a pathogen [88] . His postulates can be summarized in three points: (1) The microbe occurs in every case of the disease in question and under circumstances which can account for the pathological changes and clinical course of the disease; (2) the microbe occurs in no other disease as a fortuitous and nonpathogenic parasiteQuestion: What is Koch's second postulate?","answer":"the microbe occurs in no other disease as a fortuitous and nonpathogenic parasite"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

We combine two existing approaches namely fine tuning and multi domain NMT. We first train an NMT model on an out-of-domain parallel corpus, and then fine tune it on a parallel corpus which is a mix of the in-domain and out-of-domain corpora. All corpora are augmented with artificial tags to indicate specific domains. We empirically compare our proposed method against fine tuning and multi domain methods and discuss its benefits and shortcomings.IntroductionOne of the most attractive features of neural machine translation (NMT) BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 is that it is possible to train an end to end system without the need to deal with word alignments, translation rules and complicated decoding algorithms, which are a characteristic of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. However, it is reported that NMT works better than SMT only when there is an abundance of parallel corpora. In the case of low resource domains, vanilla NMT is either worse than or comparable to SMT BIBREF3 .Domain adaptation has been shown to be effective for low resource NMT. The conventional domain adaptation method is fine tuning, in which an out-of-domain model is further trained on in-domain data BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . However, fine tuning tends to overfit quickly due to the small size of the in-domain data. On the other hand, multi domain NMT BIBREF8 involves training a single NMT model for multiple domains. This method adds tags “<2domain>\\" by modifying the parallel corpora to indicate domains without any modifications to the NMT system architecture. However, this method has not been studied for domain adaptation in particular.Motivated by these two lines of studies, we propose a new domain adaptation method called “mixed fine tuning,\\" where we first train an NMT model on an out-of-domain parallel corpus, and then fine tune it on a parallel corpus that is a mix of the in-domain and out-of-domain corpora. Fine tuning on the mixed corpus instead of the in-domain corpus can address the overfitting problem. All corpora are augmented with artificial tags to indicate specific domains. We tried two different corpora settings:We observed that “mixed fine tuning\\" works significantly better than methods that use fine tuning and domain tag based approaches separately. Our contributions are twofold:Related WorkBesides fine tuning and multi domian NMT using tags, another direction for domain adaptation is using in-domain monolingual data. Either training an in-domain recurrent neural language (RNN) language model for the NMT decoder BIBREF13 or generating synthetic data by back translating target in-domain monolingual data BIBREF5 have been studied.Methods for ComparisonAll the methods that we compare are simple and do not need any modifications to the NMT system.Fine TuningFine tuning is the conventional way for domain adaptation, and thus serves as a baseline in this study. In this method, we first train an NMT system on a resource rich out-of-domain corpus till convergence, and then fine tune its parameters on a resource poor in-domain corpus (Figure 1 ).Multi DomainThe multi domain method is originally motivated by BIBREF14 , which uses tags to control the politeness of NMT translations. The overview of this method is shown in the dotted section in Figure 2 . In this method, we simply concatenate the corpora of multiple domains with two small modifications: a. Appending the domain tag “<2domain>\\" to the source sentences of the respective corpora. This primes the NMT decoder to generate sentences for the specific domain. b. Oversampling the smaller corpus so that the training procedure pays equal attention to each domain.We can further fine tune the multi domain model on the in-domain data, which is named as “multi domain + fine tuning.”Mixed Fine TuningThe proposed mixed fine tuning method is a combination of the above methods (shown in Figure 2 ). The training procedure is as follows:Train an NMT model on out-of-domain data till convergence.Resume training the NMT model from step 1 on a mix of in-domain and out-of-domain data (by oversampling the in-domain data) till convergence.By default, we utilize domain tags, but we also consider settings where we do not use them (i.e., “w/o tags”). We can further fine tune the model from step 2 on the in-domain data, which is named as “mixed fine tuning + fine tuning.”Note that in the “fine tuning” method, the vocabulary obtained from the out-of-domain data is used for the in-domain data; while for the “multi domain” and “mixed fine tuning” methods, we use a vocabulary obtained from the mixed in-domain and out-of-domain data for all the training stages.Experimental SettingsWe conducted NMT domain adaptation experiments in two different settings as follows:High Quality In-domain Corpus SettingChinese-to-English translation was the focus of the high quality in-domain corpus setting. We utilized the resource rich patent out-of-domain data to augment the resource poor spoken language in-domain data. The patent domain MT was conducted on the Chinese-English subtask (NTCIR-CE) of the patent MT task at the NTCIR-10 workshop BIBREF9 . The NTCIR-CE task uses 1000000, 2000, and 2000 sentences for training, development, and testing, respectively. The spoken domain MT was conducted on the Chinese-English subtask (IWSLT-CE) of the TED talk MT task at the IWSLT 2015 workshop BIBREF10 . The IWSLT-CE task contains 209,491 sentences for training. We used the dev 2010 set for development, containing 887 sentences. We evaluated all methods on the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 test sets, containing 1570, 1245, 1397, and 1261 sentences, respectively.Low Quality In-domain Corpus SettingChinese-to-Japanese translation was the focus of the low quality in-domain corpus setting. We utilized the resource rich scientific out-of-domain data to augment the resource poor Wikipedia (essentially open) in-domain data. The scientific domain MT was conducted on the Chinese-Japanese paper excerpt corpus (ASPEC-CJ) BIBREF11 , which is one subtask of the workshop on Asian translation (WAT) BIBREF15 . The ASPEC-CJ task uses 672315, 2090, and 2107 sentences for training, development, and testing, respectively. The Wikipedia domain task was conducted on a Chinese-Japanese corpus automatically extracted from Wikipedia (WIKI-CJ) BIBREF12 using the ASPEC-CJ corpus as a seed. The WIKI-CJ task contains 136013, 198, and 198 sentences for training, development, and testing, respectively.MT SystemsFor NMT, we used the KyotoNMT system BIBREF16 . The NMT training settings are the same as those of the best systems that participated in WAT 2016. The sizes of the source and target vocabularies, the source and target side embeddings, the hidden states, the attention mechanism hidden states, and the deep softmax output with a 2-maxout layer were set to 32,000, 620, 1000, 1000, and 500, respectively. We used 2-layer LSTMs for both the source and target sides. ADAM was used as the learning algorithm, with a dropout rate of 20% for the inter-layer dropout, and L2 regularization with a weight decay coefficient of 1e-6. The mini batch size was 64, and sentences longer than 80 tokens were discarded. We early stopped the training process when we observed that the BLEU score of the development set converges. For testing, we self ensembled the three parameters of the best development loss, the best development BLEU, and the final parameters. Beam size was set to 100.For performance comparison, we also conducted experiments on phrase based SMT (PBSMT). We used the Moses PBSMT system BIBREF17 for all of our MT experiments. For the respective tasks, we trained 5-gram language models on the target side of the training data using the KenLM toolkit with interpolated Kneser-Ney discounting, respectively. In all of our experiments, we used the GIZA++ toolkit for word alignment; tuning was performed by minimum error rate training BIBREF18 , and it was re-run for every experiment.For both MT systems, we preprocessed the data as follows. For Chinese, we used KyotoMorph for segmentation, which was trained on the CTB version 5 (CTB5) and SCTB BIBREF19 . For English, we tokenized and lowercased the sentences using the tokenizer.perl script in Moses. Japanese was segmented using JUMAN BIBREF20 .For NMT, we further split the words into sub-words using byte pair encoding (BPE) BIBREF21 , which has been shown to be effective for the rare word problem in NMT. Another motivation of using sub-words is making the different domains share more vocabulary, which is important especially for the resource poor domain. For the Chinese-to-English tasks, we trained two BPE models on the Chinese and English vocabularies, respectively. For the Chinese-to-Japanese tasks, we trained a joint BPE model on both of the Chinese and Japanese vocabularies, because Chinese and Japanese could share some vocabularies of Chinese characters. The number of merge operations was set to 30,000 for all the tasks.ResultsTables 1 and 2 show the translation results on the Chinese-to-English and Chinese-to-Japanese tasks, respectively. The entries with SMT and NMT are the PBSMT and NMT systems, respectively; others are the different methods described in Section \\"Methods for Comparison\\" . In both tables, the numbers in bold indicate the best system and all systems that were not significantly different from the best system. The significance tests were performed using the bootstrap resampling method BIBREF22 at p < 0.05 .We can see that without domain adaptation, the SMT systems perform significantly better than the NMT system on the resource poor domains, i.e., IWSLT-CE and WIKI-CJ; while on the resource rich domains, i.e., NTCIR-CE and ASPEC-CJ, NMT outperforms SMT. Directly using the SMT/NMT models trained on the out-of-domain data to translate the in-domain data shows bad performance. With our proposed “Mixed fine tuning\\" domain adaptation method, NMT significantly outperforms SMT on the in-domain tasks.Comparing different domain adaptation methods, “Mixed fine tuning” shows the best performance. We believe the reason for this is that “Mixed fine tuning” can address the over-fitting problem of “Fine tuning.” We observed that while “Fine tuning” overfits quickly after only 1 epoch of training, “Mixed fine tuning” only slightly overfits until covergence. In addition, “Mixed fine tuning” does not worsen the quality of out-of-domain translations, while “Fine tuning” and “Multi domain” do. One shortcoming of “Mixed fine tuning” is that compared to “fine tuning,” it took a longer time for the fine tuning process, as the time until convergence is essentially proportional to the size of the data used for fine tuning.“Multi domain” performs either as well as (IWSLT-CE) or worse than (WIKI-CJ) “Fine tuning,” but “Mixed fine tuning” performs either significantly better than (IWSLT-CE) or is comparable to (WIKI-CJ) “Fine tuning.” We believe the performance difference between the two tasks is due to their unique characteristics. As WIKI-CJ data is of relatively poorer quality, mixing it with out-of-domain data does not have the same level of positive effects as those obtained by the IWSLT-CE data.The domain tags are helpful for both “Multi domain” and “Mixed fine tuning.” Essentially, further fine tuning on in-domain data does not help for both “Multi domain” and “Mixed fine tuning.” We believe the reason for this is that the “Multi domain” and “Mixed fine tuning” methods already utilize the in-domain data used for fine tuning.ConclusionIn this paper, we proposed a novel domain adaptation method named “mixed fine tuning” for NMT. We empirically compared our proposed method against fine tuning and multi domain methods, and have shown that it is effective but is sensitive to the quality of the in-domain data used.In the future, we plan to incorporate an RNN model into our current architecture to leverage abundant in-domain monolingual corpora. We also plan on exploring the effects of synthetic data by back translating large in-domain monolingual corpora.

ICSAT (Interferon Consensus Sequence binding protein for Activated T cells) is a lymphocyte-specific member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, originally identified through Southwestern screening of the ATL (Adult T-cell leukemia) -16T expression library. In this study, we created transgenic mice overexpressing ICSAT in lymphocytes. Although spontaneous tumorigenesis was not observed, IL-2 production with Concanavalin A stimulation was significantly increased in transgenic mice overexpressing ICSAT. ICSAT overexpression in lymphocytes seems insufficient for the leukemogenesis of ATL or multiple myeloma (MM), however, it may regulate T cell activation and its overexpression may lead to leukemogenesis via controlling IL-2 production.

The RCT reports are below.Title 1:The effect of relaxation therapy on preterm labor outcomes.Abstract 1:To examine the effect of relaxation on preterm labor outcome.                Quasi-experimental, with women who experienced preterm labor randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. The experimental group was to do a daily relaxation exercise. A third group was added to the study: women who were originally assigned to the relaxation group but were unable to adhere to the daily practice. Final data were analyzed for three groups: control (n = 40), experimental (n = 44), and nonadherent (n = 23) participants.                Women were referred to the study from physician offices and a hospital-based obstetric triage clinic in the Northwest.                Total sample was comprised of 107 women with singleton gestations, documented contractions with cervical change, and intact membranes.                The experimental group was instructed in a progressive relaxation exercise. The participants were given tapes of the exercise and instructed to do it daily.                Study outcomes included gestational age at birth, rate of pregnancy prolongation, and birth weight.                The outcome variables were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with the preterm labor risk score entered as a covariate to compensate statistically for group differences. A positive response to the relaxation intervention was found: The experimental group had significantly longer gestations and larger newborns when compared to the control and nonadherent groups.                Relaxation therapy made a difference in preterm labor outcome. Women who practiced relaxation had larger newborns, longer gestations, and higher rates of pregnancy prolongation. Given the low cost of the intervention, it should be offered to all women at risk for preterm labor.Title 2:Does relaxation education in anxious primigravid Iranian women influence adverse pregnancy outcomes?: a randomized controlled trial.Abstract 2:Maternal anxiety and stress are found to be predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight and prematurity.                The aim of the study was to determine whether relaxation education in anxious pregnant Iranian women in their first pregnancy affects selected pregnancy outcomes, including birth weight, preterm birth, and surgical delivery rate.                A total of 110 obstetrically and medically low-risk primigravid women in Iran with a high anxiety level demonstrated by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups.                In this randomized controlled trial, the experimental group received routine prenatal care along with 7-week applied relaxation training sessions, while the control group received only routine prenatal care. Anxiety and perceived stress were measured by pre-educational and post-educational intervention. Data related to pregnancy outcomes include birth weight, gestational age at birth, and type of delivery.                Significant reductions in low birth weight, cesarean section, and/or instrumental extraction were found in the experimental group compared with the control group. No significant differences were found in the rate of preterm birth.                The findings suggest beneficial effects of nurse-led relaxation education sessions during the prenatal period. This intervention could serve as a resource for improving pregnancy outcomes in women with high anxiety.Title 3:Effect of integrated yoga on stress and heart rate variability in pregnant women.Abstract 3:To study the effect of integrated yoga practice and guided yogic relaxation on both perceived stress and measured autonomic response in healthy pregnant women.                The 122 healthy women recruited between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy at prenatal clinics in Bangalore, India, were randomized to practicing yoga and deep relaxation or standard prenatal exercises 1-hour daily. The results for the 45 participants per group who completed the study were evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance.                Perceived stress decreased by 31.57% in the yoga group and increased by 6.60% in the control group (P=0.001). During a guided relaxation period in the yoga group, compared with values obtained before a practice session, the high-frequency band of the heart rate variability spectrum (parasympathetic) increased by 64% in the 20th week and by 150% in the 36th week, and both the low-frequency band (sympathetic), and the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio were concomitantly reduced (P<0.001 between the 2 groups). Moreover, the low-frequency band remained decreased after deep relaxation in the 36th week in the yoga group.                Yoga reduces perceived stress and improves adaptive autonomic response to stress in healthy pregnant women.Title 4:Massage therapy effects on depressed pregnant women.Abstract 4:Eighty-four depressed pregnant women were recruited during the second trimester of pregnancy and randomly assigned to a massage therapy group, a progressive muscle relaxation group or a control group that received standard prenatal care alone. These groups were compared to each other and to a non-depressed group at the end of pregnancy. The massage therapy group participants received two 20 min therapy sessions by their significant others each week for 16 weeks of pregnancy, starting during the second trimester. The relaxation group provided themselves with progressive muscle relaxation sessions on the same time schedule. Immediately after the massage therapy sessions on the first and last days of the 16-week period the women reported lower levels of anxiety and depressed mood and less leg and back pain. By the end of the study the massage group had higher dopamine and serotonin levels and lower levels of cortisol and norepinephrine. These changes may have contributed to the reduced fetal activity and the better neonatal outcome for the massage group (i.e. lesser incidence of prematurity and low birthweight), as well as their better performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment. The data suggest that depressed pregnant women and their offspring can benefit from massage therapy.Title 5:Music therapy to relieve anxiety in pregnant women on bedrest: a randomized, controlled trial.Abstract 5:To explore the effect of music therapy on anxiety alleviation for antepartal women on bedrest in China.                One hundred and twenty patients recruited from one tertiary hospital in Changsha city, China were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Women in the experimental group received music therapy for 30 minutes on 3 consecutive days. Usual care participants had a 30-minute rest on 3 consecutive days. Variables included anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and physiological responses (vital signs, fetal heart rate). Descriptive statistics, t tests, chi tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and Pearson correlation analyses were used to analyze the data.                Anxiety levels decreased and physiological responses improved significantly in the intervention group, which was provided with music therapy while on bedrest.                Carefully selected music that incorporates a patient's own preferences may offer an inexpensive and effective method to reduce anxiety for antepartal women with high risk pregnancies who are on bedrest.Title 6:Psychological factors in preterm labor and psychotherapeutic intervention.Abstract 6:nanTitle 7:The effect of participating in the labor preparation classes on maternal vitality and positive affect during the pregnancy and after the labor.Abstract 7:Pregnant women predispose to physical and emotional diseases. Vitality and positive affect are against the depression and low energetic mood Exercise and physical activities in pregnancy have short and long term consequences for mothers and their growing fetus and affected in mood regulation. Respiratory and relaxation skills could decrease stress, pain and use of analgesics during labor.                In this study, 117 primigravida and multigravida women (59 women in case and 58 in control groups) were enrolled. Women in case group participated in delivery preparation classes since 20 weeks of pregnancy for 8 sessions. The control group was just received routine pregnancy care. The education was about pregnancy and delivery, physical exercises and relaxation skills. Questionnaires of vitality and positive affect toward the labor were completed three times: before intervention, after the 8(th) session and after delivery to 2 weeks later by an interview. Data analyzed using SPSS16 software and repeated measurement.                There was a significant difference in vitality and positive affect regarding type of delivery before and after intervention and after delivery in case group(p < 0.0001).There was no significant difference in vitality and positive affect scores after delivery and after intervention (p < 0.083, p < 0.545). There was significant difference in vitality and positive affect scores regarding between case and control groups after the intervention and after the delivery (p < 0.001, p < 0.0001).                Considering the results of this study, it could be recommended that all pregnant women should contribute in delivery preparation classes to improve their mood, confidence, vitality toward labor.","answer":"According to the results of this review, there is some evidence that relaxation during pregnancy reduces stress and anxiety.

We propose a black-box approach for injecting the missing information to a pre-trained neural machine translation system, allowing to control the morphological variations in the generated translations without changing the underlying model or training data. We evaluate our method on an English to Hebrew translation task, and show that it is effective in injecting the gender and number information and that supplying the correct information improves the translation accuracy in up to 2.3 BLEU on a female-speaker test set for a state-of-the-art online black-box system. Finally, we perform a fine-grained syntactic analysis of the generated translations that shows the effectiveness of our method.Morphological Ambiguity in TranslationDifferent languages use different morphological features marking different properties on different elements. For example, English marks for number, case, aspect, tense, person, and degree of comparison. However, English does not mark gender on nouns and verbs. Even when a certain property is marked, languages differ in the form and location of the marking BIBREF0 . For example, marking can occur on the head of a syntactic dependency construction, on its argument, on both (requiring agreement), or on none of them. Translation systems must generate correct target-language morphology as part of the translation process. This requires knowledge of both the source-side and target-side morphology. Current state-of-the-art translation systems do capture many aspects of natural language, including morphology, when a relevant context is available BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , but resort to “guessing” based on the training-data statistics when it is not. Complications arise when different languages convey different kinds of information in their morphological systems. In such cases, a translation system may be required to remove information available in the source sentence, or to add information not available in it, where the latter can be especially tricky.Black-Box Knowledge InjectionOur goal is to supply an NMT system with knowledge regarding the speaker and interlocutor of first-person sentences, in order to produce the desired target-side morphology when the information is not available in the source sentence. The approach we take in the current work is that of black-box injection, in which we attempt to inject knowledge to the input in order to influence the output of a trained NMT system, without having access to its internals or its training procedure as proposed by vanmassenhove-hardmeier-way:2018:EMNLP.We are motivated by recent work by BIBREF4 who showed that NMT systems learn to track coreference chains when presented with sufficient discourse context. We conjecture that there are enough sentence-internal pronominal coreference chains appearing in the training data of large-scale NMT systems, such that state-of-the-art NMT systems can and do track sentence-internal coreference. We devise a wrapper method to make use of this coreference tracking ability by introducing artificial antecedents that unambiguously convey the desired gender and number properties of the speaker and audience.More concretely, a sentence such as “I love you” is ambiguous with respect to the gender of the speaker and the gender and number of the audience. However, sentences such as “I love you, she told him” are unambiguous given the coreference groups {I, she} and {you, him} which determine I to be feminine singular and you to be masculine singular. We can thus inject the desired information by prefixing a sentence with short generic sentence fragment such as “She told him:” or “She told them that”, relying on the NMT system's coreference tracking abilities to trigger the correctly marked translation, and then remove the redundant translated prefix from the generated target sentence. We observed that using a parataxis construction (i.e. “she said to him:”) almost exclusively results in target-side parataxis as well (in 99.8% of our examples), making it easy to identify and strip the translated version from the target side. Moreover, because the parataxis construction is grammatically isolated from the rest of the sentence, it can be stripped without requiring additional changes or modification to the rest of the sentence, ensuring grammaticality.Experiments & ResultsTo demonstrate our method in a black-box setting, we focus our experiments on Google's machine translation system (GMT), accessed through its Cloud API. To test the method on real-world sentences, we consider a monologue from the stand-up comedy show “Sarah Silverman: A Speck of Dust”. The monologue consists of 1,244 English sentences, all by a female speaker conveyed to a plural, gender-neutral audience. Our parallel corpora consists of the 1,244 English sentences from the transcript, and their corresponding Hebrew translations based on the Hebrew subtitles. We translate the monologue one sentence at a time through the Google Cloud API. Eyeballing the results suggest that most of the translations use the incorrect, but default, masculine and singular forms for the speaker and the audience, respectively. We expect that by adding the relevant condition of “female speaking to an audience” we will get better translations, affecting both the gender of the speaker and the number of the audience.To verify this, we experiment with translating the sentences with the following variations: No Prefix—The baseline translation as returned by the GMT system. “He said:”—Signaling a male speaker. We expect to further skew the system towards masculine forms. “She said:”—Signaling a female speaker and unknown audience. As this matches the actual speaker's gender, we expect an improvement in translation of first-person pronouns and verbs with first-person pronouns as subjects. “I said to them:”—Signaling an unknown speaker and plural audience. “He said to them:”—Masculine speaker and plural audience. “She said to them:”—Female speaker and plural audience—the complete, correct condition. We expect the best translation accuracy on this setup. “He/she said to him/her”—Here we set an (incorrect) singular gender-marked audience, to investigate our ability to control the audience morphology.Quantitative ResultsWe compare the different conditions by comparing BLEU BIBREF5 with respect to the reference Hebrew translations. We use the multi-bleu.perl script from the Moses toolkit BIBREF6 . Table shows BLEU scores for the different prefixes. The numbers match our expectations: Generally, providing an incorrect speaker and/or audience information decreases the BLEU scores, while providing the correct information substantially improves it - we see an increase of up to 2.3 BLEU over the baseline. We note the BLEU score improves in all cases, even when given the wrong gender of either the speaker or the audience. We hypothesise this improvement stems from the addition of the word “said” which hints the model to generate a more “spoken” language which matches the tested scenario. Providing correct information for both speaker and audience usually helps more than providing correct information to either one of them individually. The one outlier is providing “She” for the speaker and “her” for the audience. While this is not the correct scenario, we hypothesise it gives an improvement in BLEU as it further reinforces the female gender in the sentence.Qualitative ResultsThe BLEU score is an indication of how close the automated translation is to the reference translation, but does not tell us what exactly changed concerning the gender and number properties we attempt to control. We perform a finer-grained analysis focusing on the relation between the injected speaker and audience information, and the morphological realizations of the corresponding elements. We parse the translations and the references using a Hebrew dependency parser. In addition to the parse structure, the parser also performs morphological analysis and tagging of the individual tokens. We then perform the following analysis.Speaker's Gender Effects: We search for first-person singular pronouns with subject case (ani, unmarked for gender, corresponding to the English I), and consider the gender of its governing verb (or adjectives in copular constructions such as \`I am nice'). The possible genders are \`masculine', \`feminine' and \`both', where the latter indicates a case where the none-diacriticized written form admits both a masculine and a feminine reading. We expect the gender to match the ones requested in the prefix.Interlocutors' Gender and Number Effects: We search for second-person pronouns and consider their gender and number. For pronouns in subject position, we also consider the gender and number of their governing verbs (or adjectives in copular constructions). For a singular audience, we expect the gender and number to match the requested ones. For a plural audience, we expect the masculine-plural forms.Results: Speaker. Figure FIGREF3 shows the result for controlling the morphological properties of the speaker ({he, she, I} said). It shows the proportion of gender-inflected verbs for the various conditions and the reference. We see that the baseline system severely under-predicts the feminine form of verbs as compared to the reference. The “He said” conditions further decreases the number of feminine verbs, while the “I said” conditions bring it back to the baseline level. Finally, the “She said” prefixes substantially increase the number of feminine-marked verbs, bringing the proportion much closer to that of the reference (though still under-predicting some of the feminine cases).Results: Audience. The chart in Figure FIGREF3 shows the results for controlling the number of the audience (...to them vs nothing). It shows the proportion of singular vs. plural second-person pronouns on the various conditions. It shows a similar trend: the baseline system severely under-predicts the plural forms with respect to the reference translation, while adding the “to them” condition brings the proportion much closer to that of the reference.Comparison to vanmassenhove-hardmeier-way:2018:EMNLPClosely related to our work, vanmassenhove-hardmeier-way:2018:EMNLP proposed a method and an English-French test set to evaluate gender-aware translation, based on the Europarl corpus BIBREF7 . We evaluate our method (using Google Translate and the given prefixes) on their test set to see whether it is applicable to another language pair and domain. Table shows the results of our approach vs. their published results and the Google Translate baseline. As may be expected, Google Translate outperforms their system as it is trained on a different corpus and may use more complex machine translation models. Using our method improves the BLEU score even further.Other LanguagesTo test our method’s outputs on multiple languages, we run our pre-and post-processing steps with Google Translate using examples we sourced from native speakers of different languages. For every example we have an English sentence and two translations in the corresponding language, one in masculine and one in feminine form. Not all examples are using the same source English sentence as different languages mark different information. Table shows that for these specific examples our method worked on INLINEFORM0 of the languages we had examples for, while for INLINEFORM1 languages both translations are masculine, and for 1 language both are feminine.Related WorkE17-1101 showed that given input with author traits like gender, it is possible to retain those traits in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models. W17-4727 showed that incorporating morphological analysis in the decoder improves NMT performance for morphologically rich languages. burlot:hal-01618387 presented a new protocol for evaluating the morphological competence of MT systems, indicating that current translation systems only manage to capture some morphological phenomena correctly.

Most closely to our work, vanmassenhove-hardmeier-way:2018:EMNLP also addressed the missing gender information by training proprietary models with a gender-indicating-prefix. We differ from this work by treating the problem in a black-box manner, and by addressing additional information like the number of the speaker and the gender and number of the audience.ConclusionsWe highlight the problem of translating between languages with different morphological systems, in which the target translation must contain gender and number information that is not available in the source. We propose a method for injecting such information into a pre-trained NMT model in a black-box setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by showing an improvement of 2.3 BLEU in an English-to-Hebrew translation setting where the speaker and audience gender can be inferred. We also perform a fine-grained syntactic analysis that shows how our method enables to control the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, together with verbs and adjectives related to them. In future work we would like to explore automatic generation of the injected context, or the use of cross-sentence context to infer the injected information.Table 1: BLEU results on the Silverman datasetFigure 1: Gender inflection statistics for verbs governed by first-person pronouns.Table 2: Comparison of our approach (using Google Translate) to Vanmassenhove et al.

The pressure-natriuresis and -diuresis relationships in response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade were evaluated. Renal renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide (NO) system gene expression was also investigated. Six-week-old dTGR were treated for 3 wk with submaximal doses of cilazapril (10 mg/kg, orally) or losartan (10 mg/kg, orally) or with the drug combination. In untreated dTGR, pressure-natriuresis relationships were maximally shifted rightward by approximately 70 to 80 mmHg, and both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were markedly decreased. Submaximal cilazapril and losartan dosages both decreased systolic BP by 30 mmHg and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward by 25 to 30 mmHg. Cilazapril increased RBF and GFR to values observed in normotensive control animals but did not significantly affect fractional sodium excretion (FENa) or fractional water excretion (FEH2O) curves. In contrast, losartan had no significant effect on RBF or GFR but shifted the FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. The cilazapril and losartan combination completely normalized BP and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward more than did either drug alone. When cilazapril and losartan were administered at higher doses (30 mg/kg, orally), the two drugs equally shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward, by 50 mmHg. Both drugs increased RBF and GFR; however, only losartan shifted FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. Human and rat renin and angiotensinogen genes were downregulated in dTGR and were increased by losartan and cilazapril treatments, whereas no changes in the expression of rat ACE and AT1A receptor genes were observed. Endothelial NO synthase expression was increased by cilazapril but not by losartan. Neither inducible NO synthase nor neural NO synthase gene expression was affected by drug treatments. Therefore, submaximal ACE inhibition enhanced sodium excretion mainly by increasing RBF and GFR, whereas submaximal AT1 receptor blockade decreased tubular sodium and water reabsorption. The combination of the two drugs produced an additive effect. The ACE inhibitor effects may involve increased endothelial NO synthase expression, perhaps related to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"cilazapril\\", \\"bradykinin\\", \\"sodium\\", \\"Angiotensin\\", \\"losartan\\", \\"nitric oxide\\", \\"Cilazapril\\", \\"angiotensin\\", \\"NO\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Renal renin\\", \\"bradykinin\\", \\"rat ACE\\", \\"ACE\\", \\"inducible NO synthase\\", \\"angiotensin-converting enzyme\\", \\"endothelial NO synthase\\", \\"human angiotensinogen\\", \\"neural NO synthase\\", \\"human renin\\", \\"AT1\\", \\"AT1A\\", \\"Angiotensin-converting enzyme\\", \\"Endothelial NO synthase\\", \\"angiotensinogen\\", \\"angiotensin\\", \\"Human and rat renin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We have isolated a human cDNA which encodes a novel I kappa B family member using a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins able to interact with the p52 subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The protein is found in many cell types and its expression is up-regulated following NF-kappa B activation and during myelopoiesis. Consistent with its proposed role as an I kappa B molecule, I kappa B-epsilon is able to inhibit NF-kappa B-directed transactivation via cytoplasmic retention of rel proteins. I kappa B-epsilon translation initiates from an internal ATG codon to give rise to a protein of 45 kDa, which exists as multiple phosphorylated isoforms in resting cells. Unlike the other inhibitors, it is found almost exclusively in complexes containing RelA and/or cRel. Upon activation, I kappa B-epsilon protein is degraded with slow kinetics by a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Similarly to I kappa B-alpha and I kappa B, I kappa B-epsilon contains multiple ankyrin repeats and two conserved serines which are necessary for signal-induced degradation of the molecule. A unique lysine residue located N-terminal of the serines appears to be not strictly required for degradation. Unlike I kappa B- alpha and I kappa B-beta, I kappa B-epsilon does not contain a C-terminal PEST-like sequence. I kappa B-epsilon would, therefore, appear to regulate a late, transient activation of a subset of genes, regulated by RelA/cRel NF-kappa B complexes, distinct from those regulated by other I kappa B proteins.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"RelA\\", \\"I kappa B-beta\\", \\"I kappa B-epsilon\\", \\"I kappa B- alpha\\", \\"I kappa B epsilon\\", \\"I kappa B-alpha\\", \\"NF-kappa B\\", \\"C-terminal PEST-like sequence\\", \\"cRel\\", \\"I kappa B\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

(2018) proposed using a consistent gradient estimator as an economic alternative.Encouraged by empirical success, we show, in a general setting, that consistent estimators result in the same convergence behavior as do unbiased ones.Our analysis covers strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives.We verify the results with illustrative experiments on synthetic and real-world data.This work opens several new research directions, including the development of more efficient SGD updates with consistent estimators and the design of efficient training algorithms for large-scale graphs.Consider the standard setting of supervised learning.There exists a joint probability distribution P (x, y) of data x and associated label y and the task is to train a predictive model, parameterized by w, that minimizes the expected loss between the prediction and the ground truth y.Let us organize the random variables as ξ = (x, y) and use the notation (w; ξ) for the loss.If ξ i = (x i , y i ), i = 1, . . . , n, are iid training examples drawn from P , then the objective function is either one of the following well-known forms: expected risk f (w) = E[ (w; ξ)]; empirical risk f (w) = 1 n n i=1 (w; ξ i ).Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which dates back to the seminal work of Robbins & Monro (1951) , has become the de-facto optimization method for solving these problems in machine learning.In SGD, the model parameter is updated until convergence with the rulewhere γ k is a step size and g k is an unbiased estimator of the gradient ∇f (w k ).Compared with the full gradient (as is used in deterministic gradient descent), an unbiased estimator involves only one or a few training examples ξ i and is usually much more efficient to compute.","answer":"Convergence theory for biased (but consistent) gradient estimators in stochastic optimization and application to graph convolutional networks"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, the molecular mechanism of REM-sleep regulation by the OB is unknown. Adenosine promotes sleep and its A2A receptors (A2AR) are expressed in the OB. We hypothesized that A2AR in the OB regulate REM sleep. Bilateral microinjections of the A2AR antagonist SCH58261 into the rat OB increased REM sleep, whereas microinjections of the A2AR agonist CGS21680 decreased REM sleep. Similar to the A2AR antagonist, selective A2AR knockdown by adeno-associated virus carrying short-hairpin RNA for A2AR in the rat OB increased REM sleep. Using chemogenetics on the basis of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, we demonstrated that the inhibition of A2AR neurons increased REM sleep, whereas the activation of these neurons decreased REM sleep. Moreover, using a conditional anterograde axonal tract-tracing approach, we found that OB A2AR neurons innervate the piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle. These novel findings indicate that adenosine suppresses REM sleep via A2AR in the OB of rodents.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"olfactory bulb\\", \\"piriform cortex\\", \\"olfactory tubercle\\", \\"A2AR\\", \\"OB\\", \\"neurons\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"sleep\\", \\"detect odors\\", \\"REM-sleep\\", \\"REM sleep\\", \\"molecular mechanism\\", \\"inhibition\\", \\"regulate\\", \\"regulation\\", \\"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder\\", \\"rapid eye movement sleep\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"chemogenetics\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"designer receptors\\", \\"A2AR agonist CGS21680\\", \\"short-hairpin RNA\\", \\"A2A receptors\\", \\"Adenosine\\", \\"A2AR antagonist SCH58261\\", \\"A2AR antagonist\\", \\"Adenosine A2A receptors\\", \\"designer drugs\\", \\"A2AR\\", \\"adenosine\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"rat\\", \\"humans\\", \\"rodents\\", \\"rats\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"olfactory bulbectomized\\", \\"ability to smell\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"Bilateral microinjections\\", \\"microinjections\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"anterograde axonal tract-tracing approach\\", \\"knockdown\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": [\\"adeno-associated virus\\"]}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

We develop a generalized transformation-based gradient model based on the velocity field related to the generalized transformation and explicitly propose the unbiasedness constraint on the G-TRANS gradient.The proposed gradient model provides a more poweful and flexible way to construct gradient estimators.2. We show that our model is a generalization of the score function method and the reparameterization trick.Our gradient model can reduce to the reparameterization trick by enforcing a transport equation constraint on the velocity field.We also show our model's connection to control variate method.3. We propose a polynomial-based gradient estimator that cannot be induced by any other existing generalized reparameterization gradient framework, and show its superiority over similar works on several experiments.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.In Sec.2 we review the stochastic gradient variational inference (SGVI) and stochastic gradient estimators.In Sec.3 we propose the generalized transformation-based gradient.In Sec.4 we propose the polynomial-based G-TRANS gradient estimator.In Sec.5 we study the performance of our gradient estimator on synthetic and real data.In Sec.6 we review the related works.In Sec.7 we conclude this paper and discuss future work.We proposed a generalized transformation-based (G-TRANS) gradient model which extends the reparameterization trick to a larger class of variational distributions.Our gradient model hides the details of transformation by introducing the velocity field and provides a flexible way to construct gradient estimators.Based on the proposed gradient model, we introduced a polynomial-based G-TRANS gradient estimator that cannot be induced by any other existing generalized reparameterization gradient framework.In practice, our gradient estimator provides a lower gradient variance than other state-of-the-art methods, leading to a fast converging process.For future work, We can consider how to construct G-TRANS gradient estimators for distributions that don't have analytical high-order moments.We can also utilize the results from the approximation theory to find certain kinds of high-order polynomial functions that can approximate the test function effectively with cheap computations for the coefficients.Constructing velocity fields with the optimal transport theory is also a promising direction.","answer":"We propose a novel generalized transformation-based gradient model and propose a polynomial-based gradient estimator based upon the model."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education.(METHODS) We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships.(RESULTS) A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05).

The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] . Childhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course. Chest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization's (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \\"end-point consolidation\\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \\"Other infiltrate\\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \\"Primary end-point pneumonia\\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \\"other\\" infiltrate). Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] . The WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \\"presumed bacterial pneumonia\\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L  [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia. Empyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] . Several national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] . In addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] . A systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] . More recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] . Another etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] . Similarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas. Childhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .Question: What is the revised WHO definition of Bacterial Pneumonia?","answer":"A revised case definition of \\"presumed bacterial pneumonia\\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

This is particularly true for oxidation reactions where stoichiometric amounts of oen toxic oxidants are commonly used. 1 In contrast, nature has developed several ironbased metalloenzymes that perform the oxidation of organic substrates via high valent iron-oxo species. [2][3][4] To mimic these enzymes, a number of non-heme polypyridyl complexes have been studied extensively and employed in different oxidation reactions including C-H bond cleavage, epoxidations, and sulfoxidations, using chemical oxidants such as PhIO or peracids. 5,6 In these cases, the role of the oxidant used is twofold; it activates the Fe II precursor by the removal of two electrons to yield the active Fe IV (O) intermediate, and acts as the source of the oxygen atom that will ultimately be inserted into the reaction products. This \\"shunt\\" mechanism, which has been favored in this research eld over the naturally occurring reductive activation of O 2 at iron centers, has proven to be an easier route to high valent iron-oxo centers but hinges on the use of the above mentioned oxygen containing oxidants.</p><p>An alternative methodology to performing such reactions involves the use of both visible light as a source of energy, and water as a clean supply of electrons and O atoms in order to form energy rich reaction products. This approach, akin to the mechanism found in Photosystem II, 7,8 utilizes visible light in order to activate a chromophore that in turn triggers the successive oxidation of a catalytic center which activates a bound water molecule in the form of a metal-oxo species through a series of proton coupled electron transfer reactions (PCET) (Fig. 1, eqn (1)-( 6)). 9,10 This strategy has inspired the development of a new area of research whose goal is to develop synthetic models capable of transforming light energy into chemical energy stored in chemical bonds. [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] In our laboratories we have focused our efforts on the study of covalently bound chromophore-catalyst complexes designed to perform the visible light activation of catalytic units. 19,20 Fig. 1 Overall mechanism to achieve oxygenation of a substrate by a Ru II -Fe II chromophore-catalyst complex upon light-induced activation of a water molecule. EA and S denote electron acceptor and substrate molecules, respectively. Protons released during steps 3 and 6 are omitted for clarity.</p><p>Photo-activation of such assemblies triggers a series of energy and electron transfer reactions which result in the formation of a charge-separated state where reductive equivalents are transferred onto a sacricial electron acceptor while oxidative power is stored at the catalytic center.</p><p>In contrast to bimolecular chromophore/catalyst systems, 14,21 these assemblies are versatile tools that not only allow the study of the complete cascade of reactions that follow activation by visible light but also offer the possibility to investigate the electronic communication between the chromophore and the catalyst. Furthermore, these types of assemblies are suitable candidates for incorporation in dye sensitized photo-electrochemical cells, where, as part of the photoanode 22,23 they can furnish electrons and protons to a hydrogenor fuel-forming cathode.</p><p>In this work, we report a full articial photosynthetic system where light absorption, management of the chromophore's excited state, sequential electron transfers, accumulation of charges at the catalyst and catalysis are achieved and characterized. Using the chromophore-catalyst complex 1-OH 2 depicted in Fig. 2, (for the detailed synthetic procedure see ESI †), visible light as the sole source of energy and water as the O atom source, we present the successive two-electron photooxidation of an iron-based catalyst. This process leads to the activation of a coordinated water molecule resulting in the formation of an active Fe IV (O) species that performs subsequent oxygen atom transfer onto a substrate (Fig. 1). The two successive light-induced oxidations of a metal-bound water molecule have rarely been conrmed spectroscopically in the past. 24</p>Results and discussion<p>The chromophore employed is a [Ru II (bpy) 3 ]-like complex whose excited state can be oxidatively quenched by a number of electron acceptors, yielding a Ru III state which has 1.30 V vs. SCE oxidative power (Fig. 1, eqn (2) and ( 5)). 25 Depending on the experiments performed, the electron acceptors used were either methyl viologen or [Co III (NH 3 ) 5 Cl] 2+ salts which, unlike 4-nitrobenzene diazonium and sodium peroxosulfate that were also tried, were the only acceptors able to oxidatively quench the excited state of the ruthenium chromophore without performing oxidation of the Fe II catalyst unit in the absence of light. 26 The catalyst is an Fe II ion wrapped by a pentadentate amine/pyridine ligand (noted as L 5 2 hereaer), known to perform the catalytic oxidation of organic substrates in the presence of oxygen containing oxidants and for which the spectroscopic signature of the Fe IV (O) intermediate has been reported. [27][28][29] The Ru II -Fe II complex was rst isolated with a chloro exogenous ligand bound to Fe II (1-Cl, see ESI †). When dissolved in 4 : 1 H 2 O : CH 3 CN (WAN), this complex exhibits two strong absorptions at 450 nm (3 ¼ 17 000 M À1 cm À1 ) due to a Ru II  The excited state properties of the photosensitizer (*Ru II ) in 1 were studied using steady state and time-resolved uorescence spectroscopy techniques. The emission of 1-OH 2 in 4 : 1 WAN is strongly quenched compared to the reference compound [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ (l max ¼ 605 nm, F ¼ 0.059) 25 and shows a maximum at 619 nm with a quantum yield of 0.0091. Emission decay, as is oen observed for dinuclear complexes based on [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ chromophores, 32,33 is biphasic with a main component of 80 ns (65%) and a minor one of 600 ns (35%). The excited state quenching is tentatively assigned to an energy transfer mechanism between the chromophore's excited state and low lying metal centered states of the catalyst unit since an electron transfer mechanism from the catalyst to the excited state of the chromophore can be ruled out by ligand exchange experiments (Table SI 1 † and accompanying text) and a resonance energy transfer process is not consistent with the absorption/emission properties of the donor (Ru) and acceptor (Fe). Furthermore, the spin state of the Fe II complex was found not to inuence this quenching as the same phenomenon was observed in the case of the low spin (S ¼ 0) cyano derivative [(L 5 2 )Fe II (CN)] + . The rst photoinduced electron transfer (Fig. 1 and eqn (3)) was studied by laser ash photolysis. The differential absorption traces aer excitation of 1-OH 2 in the presence of methyl viologen (MV 2+ ) as the reversible electron acceptor in a 4 : 1 WAN mixture, showed an increase of absorption at 605 nm together with a bleach at 450 nm (Fig. 3, top). These absorption changes are indications of the reduction of methyl viologen (MV 2+ / MVc + ) and the concomitant formation of the oxidized state of the chromophore (Ru II / Ru III ) (Fig. 1, eqn (1) and ( 2)). Recovery of the chromophore's ground state is approximately 5 times faster than that of MV 2+ implying an intramolecular electron transfer between the reduced form of the catalytic module and the oxidized chromophore (Ru III -Fe II / Ru II -Fe III ) (Fig. 1, eqn (3)). In order to investigate the changes in electronic absorption features occurring during the electron transfer process, we replaced MV 2+ by [Ru III (NH 3 ) 6 ]Cl 3 , which does not absorb in the visible region (Fig. 3, bottom). The strong initial bleaching of the Ru II MLCT at 450 nm aer excitation evolves in 60 ms into a depletion band with a maximum at 400 nm (Fig. 3, bottom) that is attributed to the formation of the Fe III state in the catalytic module. This loss of absorption at 400 nm, which originates from the loss of the Fe II to p * pyridine MLCT band, was also observed upon chemical oxidation of 1-OH 2 , and more so with reference compound 2-OH 2 , when they were treated with 2 equivalents of H 2 O 2 (Fig. SI 9 †).</p><p>To further study the change in oxidation state of the initial Fe II ion, we performed X-band EPR measurements aer continuous light excitation of a solution of 1-OH 2 in 4 : 1 WAN in the presence of [Co III (NH 3 ) 5 Cl] 2+ acting as an irreversible electron acceptor. The initial spectrum shows no observable signal due to the diamagnetic nature of the Co III and Ru II ions and the high spin Fe II S ¼ 2 state (Fig. 4, le, blue trace). Aer irradiation of this sample with 450 nm light for 2 min, the EPR spectrum exhibits a resonance at g ¼ 4.44 due to the formation of high spin Co II ions in solution and signals at g ¼ 2.34, 2.15 and 1.91 which are characteristic of low spin Fe III (OH) (S ¼ 1/2) in this family of complexes (Fig. 4, le, red trace). 21,[34][35][36] Furthermore, these resonances match those observed when 1-OH 2 is chemically oxidized using 2 eq. H 2 O 2 (Fig. 4, right). In parallel, the results of a controlled chemical oxidation performed on reference compound 2-OH 2 are consistent with the above observations (Fig. SI 10 †). Altogether, these results clearly evidence the rst activation step of the Fe-bound water molecule leading to Ru II -Fe III (OH).</p><p>The second light-induced electron transfer (Fig. 1, eqn ( 6)) needed to generate the targeted Fe IV (O) species was evidenced by studying the evolution of the EPR signals at different time intervals during continuous illumination of a solution of 1-OH 2 in 4 : 1 WAN in the presence of [Co III (NH 3 ) 5 Cl] 2+ . An increase in intensity of the EPR signals accounting for the formation of the low spin Fe III (OH) species was observed, followed by a decrease until the complete disappearance of the rhombic low-spin Fe III signal (Fig. SI 11 †). Concomitantly, we observed a persistent increase of the signal related to the photo-reduced free Co II ions in solution. These observations are supportive of a second electron transfer process from the Fe III (OH) intermediate to photogenerated Ru III leading to the probable formation of a low spin S ¼ 1 Fe IV species. A conclusive kinetic study of this second electron transfer by laser ash photolysis of Ru II -Fe III (OH) (prepared with H 2 O 2 ) in the presence of MV 2+ has not yet been</p>Conclusion<p>In summary, we have evidenced the two sequential lightinduced electron transfer reactions from a Fe II (OH 2 ) species to a covalently bound chromophore and subsequent oxygen atom transfer from the resulting Fe IV (O) intermediate. Aer the rst photon absorption, the one-electron oxidized intermediate Ru II -Fe III (OH) was identied by X-band EPR and ash photolysis methods. Further illumination of this species leads to the Ru II -Fe IV (O) intermediate which has been characterized by ESI-MS and UV-visible spectroscopy. Oxygen atom transfer from the Fe IV (O) moiety to triphenyl phosphine has been proven using 18 O labelling experiments.</p><p>While the present work conrms the validity of the concept, current efforts in our laboratories are directed towards the optimization of the system. These include improvement of the excited state properties of the chromophore-catalyst assembly in order to optimize the photo-driven electron transfer processes, implementation of a more potent oxidation catalyst, as well as synthetic modication for its incorporation in Graetzel-type semiconducting electrodes 23 in order to avoid both the use of sacricial electron acceptors and to recover the electrons obtained during light-driven oxidation reactions for their further use.</p>","answer":"In the present work we describe the synthesis and study of a Ru II -Fe II chromophore-catalyst assembly designed to perform the light-induced activation of an iron bound water molecule and subsequent photo-driven oxidation of a substrate.

theory formulation of this sector of @xmath4 is not unique .the reason is that spin-1 resonances can be described using various types of fields , the most common ones in this context are the vector proca fields and antisymmetric tensor fields ( both formalisms will be discussed briefly in section [ secpt ] ) .physical equivalence of various formulation of the spin-1 sector of @xmath4 at the order @xmath5 was studied already in the seminal paper @xcite , leading to the necessity to append additional contact terms to the proca field @xmath4 lagrangian in order to ensure both the _ formal _ equivalence with the antisymmetric tensor description ( meaning equality of the correlators ) and the _ physical _ one ( to satisfy the high energy constraints dictated by @xmath3 ) . at the @xmath0 , the situation is more complex @xcite . to obtain complete _ formal _ equivalence , one needs to add an infinite number of terms with increasing chiral order ( to the contrary to @xmath5 case not only contact terms but also terms with explicit resonance fields ) .this infinite tower of operators can be truncated , provided we confine ourselves to the saturation of the @xmath0 lecs or provided we require equality of the @xmath6-point correlators up to some @xmath7 only ( see @xcite for details ) .even in such a case , however , both formalisms are in a sense incomplete , because generally some contributions to the @xmath0 lecs are still missing in both of them and have to be added by hand ( for the tensor formalism this was made in @xcite and @xcite by means of the comparison with proca field one ). the necessity of additional terms might be required by the high energy @xmath3 constraints @xcite , however , the exhausting analysis is still missing here .    in @xcite ,another possibility to describe spin-1 resonances has been discussed , which gives automatically all the contributions to the @xmath0 lecs known from the both formalisms mentioned above and which is in some sense a synthesis of them . within this formalism, the spin-1 particles are described by a _ pair _ of vector and antisymmetric tensor fields which satisfy the first order equations of motion .the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the main idea of this _ first order formalism _ using a toy example ( see section [ secfof ] ) and also to illustrate the application of the full formalism in the concrete case of the vector formfactor of the pion ( see section [ secex ] ) .let us start with a brief review of two standard representations for the @xmath8 resonances .the first one , known from textbooks , is the familiar proca field formalism ; the ( nonet ) vector degree of freedom is represented by means of lorentz vector @xmath9 ( using gell - mann and unit matrices we have @xmath10 ) .the free field lagrangian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represents a trace in the flavour space .the second formalism uses an antisymmetric tensor @xmath14 with @xmath15 as follows from the equations of motion , this choice of the lagrangian implies that the @xmath16 degrees of freedom do not propagate .it could be shown that these two lagrangians are equivalent ( at least at the classical level ) .the interactions with the goldstone bosons follow from the symmetry properties of the underlying theory ( @xmath3 ) .resonances transform as nonet under the @xmath17 in the non - linear realization of chiral symmetry .the full lagrangian can be constructed using the standard chiral building blocks of this non - linear realization together with the resonance fields .the leading order is represented by monomials which are linear in the resonance fields and chiral blocks are fixed by the standard chpt counting scheme .these leading order monomials were first studied in @xcite and @xcite for proca and tensor formalism , respectively .    integrating out the resonances one can study directly their influence in the sector of goldstone bosons by saturation of low energy constants of @xmath1 .this can also tell us what is the order of resonance nonet from the point of view of @xmath1 ; one gets : @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 . having this powercounting one can construct further higher order terms; for this we refer to @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .    as mentioned in introduction , for a given order the equivalence between @xmath22 and @xmath23one can ask which formalism is more appropriate to describe the vector resonances . intuitively , due to the lower counting and thus richer structure , one would vote for tensor formalism ( _ e.g. _ in proca formalism we have no contribution to @xmath5 lecs ) .the situation is , however , more complicated .the point is that , even in this case , one is forced to fix extra contact terms ( _ i.e. _ terms without resonances ) in order to make the theory consistent . for instance ( cf .@xcite ) at the order @xmath0 , the froissart bound applied to the @xmath24 compton scattering amplitude calculated within the tensor formalism requires to add one such contact term . what is , however, interesting is that this term arises naturally in proca formalism. it would be therefore useful to formulate the resonance theory in a way which would take advantages of both formalisms at once .this can be done using the first order formalism with the ( free ) lagrangian of the form @xmath25 which was introduced in @xcite .in order to avoid cumbersome expressions with lots of indices , let us demonstrate the main ideas of the first order formalism using a toy example of the noninteracting neutral massive spin - zero particles instead of the nonet of spin-1 resonances .the former case shares all the main qualitative features with the latter and due to its relative simplicity it suits well for our illustrative purpose .spin -

It remains unknown what quantitative changes to the activity of metabolism are necessary and sufficient for this phenotype. We developed a computational model of glycolysis and an integrated analysis using metabolic control analysis( MCA), metabolomics data, and statistical simulations. We identified and confirmed a novel mode of regulation specific to aerobic glycolysis where flux through GAPDH, the enzyme separating lower and upper glycolysis, is the rate-limiting step in the pathway and the levels of fructose( 1, 6) bisphosphate( FBP), are predictive of the rate and control points in glycolysis. Strikingly, negative flux control was found and confirmed for several steps thought to be rate-limiting in glycolysis. Together, these findings enumerate the biochemical determinants of the WE and suggest strategies for identifying the contexts in which agents that target glycolysis might be most effective.Introduction:Proliferating cells increase their glucose consumption and secrete lactate as opposed to completely oxidizing the glucose in the mitochondria( Warburg et al., 1927) and is known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg Effect. Currently, this altered metabolism is exploited for diagnostics and is subjected to multiple drug development efforts( Koppenol et al., 2011; Vander Heiden, 2011; Hamanaka and Chandel, 2012). Numerous studies have identified genes such as KRAS, PIK3CA, and cMYC and microenvironments such as hypoxia and hypoglycemia that promote aerobic glycolysis but a complete understanding of the necessary and sufficient biochemical alterations associated with this phenotype is unknown. Furthermore successful translation for biomedical applications is limited by understanding the contexts in which therapies that target glycolysis might be effective. Computational modeling has a successful history in the study of metabolism( Rapoport et al., 1976; Fell, 1992; Schilling et al., 1999; Cascante et al., 2002). Genome-scale stoichiometric models of metabolism have been developed to study the effects of drug targets in human metabolism and have had success in predicting the WE( Molenaar et al., 2009; Vazquez et al., 2010; Folger et al., 2011; Shlomi et al., 2011). However, a comprehensive quantitative understanding of the WE requires knowledge of enzyme activities and metabolic control. Therefore, we collected and integrated multiple forms of data into a modeling framework involving flux balances of glycolysis, detailed chemical kinetics based on reaction mechanisms and parameters measured, physico-chemical constraints from thermodynamics and mass conservation, metabolic control analysis, and Monte Carlo sampling of parameter space. We next use mass spectrometry and isotope tracing to probe concentrations and fluxes through the pathway and their responses to several perturbations. Together, we elaborate the determinants of aerobic glycolysis and identify and confirm novel points of regulation in glycolysis that have remained unidentified for over 50 years since the discovery of the pathway.Discussion:Together, our analysis yields a comprehensive, quantitative framework for understanding glycolysis and its regulation in the context of the Warburg Effect. Historically, glycolysis is thought to have a rate-limiting step at several points in the pathway( Chance and Hess, 1956; Wu, 1965). These points correspond to positions in the pathway where large free energy differences arise including the ATP-coupled enzymes Hexokinase, Phosphofructokinase, and Pyruvate Kinase( Rose and Warms, 1966; Rapoport et al., 1976; Hue and Rider, 1987). Surprisingly, we identified a strong context-dependence with both positive and negative control in glycolysis at each of these steps. In the case of inhibiting flux through PFK, the observed negative control in certain conditions implies that inhibiting this point in the pathway can lead to increased rates of fermentation. This finding provides a possible explanation for why its efficacy may be more prevalent in stromal cells( Schoors et al., 2014). Unexpectedly, GAPDH was found to be a recurrent rate-controlling step in aerobic glycolysis. This finding, first documented to our knowledge in parasitic bacteria feeding on high glucose( Bakker et al., 1999), is in contrast to the longstanding notion that GAPDH is not a rate-determining enzyme in glycolysis with the activity of enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase thought to be more controlling. In the case of GAPDH, the bottleneck occurs due to its unique placement in the pathway where it can be regulated by ATP, NAD+, and the levels of glucose-derived intermediates in the pathway that affects the thermodynamics of glycolysis. There are multiple mechanisms that lead to this finding. ATP consumption has previously been reported to control the rate of glycolysis and this effect likely occurs to some extent through GAPDH( Racker, 1976; Locasale and Cantley, 2011; Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011). NAD+ regeneration that is mediated by the malate–aspartate shuttle and lactate dehydrogenase also affects flux through glycolysis( DeBerardinis et al., 2008; Locasale and Cantley, 2011). In addition, the activity of the pathway upstream and downstream of GAPDH changes the balance of the levels of intermediates in glycolysis and results in driving the thermodynamics of the reactions out of equilibrium also can result in greater flux control( Noor et al., 2014). Each of these mechanisms separately or together acts to allow for GAPDH to exert flux control over the glycolytic pathway. Enzymes along glycolysis that are believed to control flux have many documented regulatory mechanisms. For example pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase have numerous small molecule effectors and post-translational modifications that affect their activities( Mor et al., 2011; Chaneton and Gottlieb, 2012; Keller et al., 2012; Yi, et al., 2012). It is notable that GAPDH also is subject to multiple forms of regulation including post-translational modifications such as nitrosylation and reactive oxygen species( ROS) that interacts with the catalytic cysteine in GAPDH to inhibit its activity( Gaupels et al., 2011; Tristan et al., 2011; Moellering and Cravatt, 2013). In the context of ROS, it is tempting to speculate that alterations in ROS could lead to selective modulation of glycolytic flux as has been suggested to occur with pyruvate kinase( Anastasiou et al., 2011). While ROS-mediated inhibition is unlikely in conditions of exponential growth, it may be more apparent in physiological conditions of hypoxia and glucose deprivation with higher concentrations of ROS. Another critical aspect of the flux control that GAPDH exerts over the glycolytic pathway is high expression of GAPDH in cells undergoing aerobic glycolysis. Indeed, reports of quantitative protein abundance in mammalian cells have identified enzymes in the pathway glycolysis as the most highly expressed collective of proteins in cells( Moghaddas Gholami et al., 2013). Interestingly, it was found that within glycolysis, GAPDH is often the mostly highly concentrated protein in glycolysis suggesting that the role of this high expression in these cases is to support the increased amount of glycolytic flux in these cells. Nevertheless, although mechanisms that regulate phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase for example have been shown to mediate cell growth and proliferation, whether regulatory mechanisms of GAPDH have functional roles in cell growth and proliferation related to aerobic glycolysis is not known. Two states of glycolysis were observed with different extents of flux control, tendencies for aerobic glycolysis, and concentration patterns along glycolysis. Notably, the FBP levels have implications on the activity of pyruvate kinase that is also allosterically activated by FBP. At low FBP concentration, pyruvate kinase is not activated by FBP but this occurs only in the high FBP state. This finding could have implications in understanding the contexts in which pharmacologically activating pyruvate kinase may have efficacy. Furthermore, it remains to be seen if any signature of these metabolite states could manifest in the alterations of peripheral metabolism involving pathways whose fluxes emanate from glycolysis. If this were the case, then a tempting possibility would be that these states of glycolysis could be predicted from measurements of peripheral metabolites that could be excreted into circulation allowing for the possibility of developing serum biomarkers for the status of glycolysis in tumors beyond what can be resolved with positron emission tomography using radioactive glucose. Finally, the surge of interest in metabolism and its contribution to pathogenesis has created an expectation that therapeutics that target glucose metabolism will be clinically successful. Targeting glycolysis in metabolism has raised interest but is limited by the development of biomarkers that could determine the contexts in which targeting glucose metabolism in malignancy would be efficacious( Vander Heiden, 2011; Galluzzi et al., 2013; Vander Heiden, 2013). From our model analysis, the consequences of inhibiting glycolysis appear enormously complex that limit biomarker development due to the nonlinear mechanisms that determine the response of the pathway to a drug perturbation. Nevertheless, with the development of these predictive models that can capture diverse behaviors of glycolysis, it is worth considering whether they may have predictive capacity in pre-clinical and clinical settings.","answer":"Cells generate energy from a sugar called glucose via a process called glycolysis . This process involves many enzymes that catalyze 10 different chemical reactions , and it essentially converts glucose step-by-step into a simpler chemical called pyruvate . Pyruvate is then normally transported into structures within the cell called mitochondria , where it is further broken down using oxygen to release more energy . However , in cells that are rapidly dividing , pyruvate is converted into another chemical called lactate—which releases energy more quickly , but releases less energy overall . Cancer cells often convert most of their glucose into lactate , rather than breaking down pyruvate in their mitochondria: an observation known as the ‘Warburg effect’ . And while many factors affect how a cell releases energy from pyruvate , it remains unclear what regulates which of these biochemical processes is most common in a living cell . In this study , Shestov et al . have developed a computational model for the process of glycolysis and used this to investigate the causes of the Warburg Effect . The model was based on the known characteristics of the enzymes and chemical reactions involved at each step . It predicted that the activity of the enzyme called GAPDH , which carries out the sixth step in glycolysis , in many cases affects how much lactate is produced . This suggests that this enzyme represents a bottleneck in the pathway . Next , Shestov et al . performed experiments where they used drugs to block different stages of the glycolysis pathway , and confirmed that the GAPDH enzyme is important for regulating this pathway in living cancer cells too . In these treated cells , the levels of a chemical called fructose-1 , 6-biphosphate ( which is made in a step in the pathway between glucose and pyruvate ) were either very high or very low . Shestov et al . proposed that the flow of chemicals through the glycolysis pathway is controlled by the GAPDH enzyme when the chemicals used by the enzymes upstream of GAPDH in the pathway ( which includes fructose-1 , 6-biphosphate ) are plentiful . However , if these chemicals are limited , other enzymes that are involved in earlier steps of the pathway regulate the process instead . The findings of Shestov et al . reveal that the regulation of glycolysis is more complex than previously thought , and is also very different when cells are undergoing the Warburg Effect . In the future , these findings might help to identify the types of cancer that could be effectively treated using drugs that target the glycolysis process , which are currently being tested in pre-clinical studies ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: We labeled Jurkat TAP-Tat and Jurkat TAP cells with light (R0K0)  and heavy (R6K6) isotope containing arginine and lysine, respectively. Following five passages in their respective SILAC medium, 85 million cells from each culture were harvested, pooled and their nucleoli were isolated as previously described ( Figure 1A ) [52] . Each step of the procedure was closely monitored by microscopic examination. To assess the quality of our fractionation procedure, specific enrichment of known nucleolar antigens was investigated by Western Blot analysis ( Figure 1D ). Nucleolin (110 kDa) and Fibrillarin (FBL) (34 kDa), two major nucleolar proteins known to localise to the granular component of the nucleolus, were found to be highly enriched in the mixed nucleolar fraction. Of note, nucleolin was equally distributed between the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. This distribution pattern for nucleolin appears to be specific for Jurkat T-cells as show previously [52, 53] . The nuclear protein PARP-1 (Poly ADPribose polymerase 1) (113 kDa) was present in the nuclear and nucleoplasmic fraction but was depleted in the nucleolar fraction. Alpha-tubulin (50 kDa) was highly abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction and weakly detected in the nuclear fractions. Collectively, these results confirmed that our methods produced a highly enriched nucleolar fraction without significant cross contamination. Subsequently, the nucleolar protein mixture was trypsindigested and the resulting peptides were analysed by mass spectrometry. Comparative quantitative proteomic analysis was performed using MaxQuant to analyse the ratios in isotopes for each peptide identified. A total of 2427 peptides were quantified, representing 520 quantified nucleolar proteins. The fully annotated list of the quantified nucleolar proteins is available in Table S1 and the raw data from the mass spectrometry analysis was deposited in the Tranche repository database (https:// proteomecommons.org/tranche/), which can be accessed using the hash keys described in materials and methods. We annotated the quantified proteins using the ToppGene Suite tools [54] and extracted Gene Ontology (GO) and InterPro annotations [55] . The analysis of GO biological processes ( Figure 1F ) revealed that the best-represented biological processes included transcription (24%), RNA processing (23%), cell cycle process (13%) and chromosome organisation (15%), which reflects nucleolar associated functions and is comparable to our previous characterisation of Jurkat T-cell nucleolar proteome [52] . Subcellular distribution analysis ( Figure 1F ) revealed that our dataset contained proteins known to localise in the nucleolus (49%), in the nucleus (24%) while 15% of proteins were previously described to reside exclusively in the cytoplasm. The subcellular distribution was similar to our previous analysis of the Jurkat T-cell nucleolar proteome [52] . Table S1 . The distribution of protein ratios are represented in Figure 1G as log 2 (abundance change). The SILAC ratios indicate changes in protein abundance in the nucleolar fraction of Jurkat TAP-Tat cells in comparison with Jurkat TAP cells. The distribution of the quantified proteins followed a Gaussian distribution ( Figure 1G ). A total of 49 nucleolar proteins exhibited a 1.5 fold or greater significant change (p,0.05) upon Tat expression (Table 1) . Of these, 30 proteins were enriched, whereas 19 proteins were depleted. Cells displayed no changes in the steady state content of some of the major and abundant constituents of the nucleolus, including nucleophosmin (NPM1/ B23), C23, FBL, nucleolar protein P120 (NOL1), and nucleolar protein 5A (NOL5A). The distinct ratios of protein changes upon Tat expression could reflect specific nucleolar reorganization and altered activities of the nucleolus. We performed WB analysis to validate the SILAC-based results obtained by our quantitative proteomic approach ( Figure 2 ). 15 selected proteins displayed differential intensity in the nucleolar fractions upon Tat expression, including 9 enriched (HSP90b, STAT3, pRb, CK2a, CK2a', HSP90a, Transportin, ZAP70, DDX3), and 3 depleted (ILF3, BOP1, and SSRP1) proteins. In addition, we also tested by WB analysis, protein abundance not affected by Tat expression (Importin beta, FBL, B23, C23). These results highlight the concordance in the trend of the corresponding SILAC ratios, despite some differences in the quantitative ranges. Of note, using WB, we could observe a change of intensity for protein with a SILAC fold change as low as 1.25-fold. Of note, the question remains as to which fold change magnitude might constitute a biologically relevant consequence. On the one hand, the threshold of protein abundance changes can be determined statistically and would then highlight the larger abundance changes as illustrated in Table 1 . Alternatively, the coordinated enrichment or depletion of a majority of proteins belonging to a distinct cellular complex or pathway would allow the definition of a group of proteins of interest and potential significance. Therefore, we next focused on both enriched or depleted individual proteins with activities associated with HIV-1 or Tat molecular pathogenesis, and on clustered modifications affecting entire cellular signaling pathways and macromolecular complexes. We initially focused on signaling proteins interacting with Tat and/or associated HIV-1 molecular pathogenesis and whose abundance in the nucleolus was modulated by Tat expression. Phospho-protein phosphatases. Phospho-protein phosphatase PP1 and PP2A are essential serine/threonine phosphatases [56, 57] . Importantly, PP1 accounts for 80% of the Ser/Thr phosphatase activity within the nucleolus. In our study, PP1 was found to be potentially enriched by 1.52-fold in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells expressing Tat, which supports previous studies describing the nuclear and nucleolar targeting of PP1a by HIV-1 Tat and how PP1 upregulates HIV-1 transcription [58, 59, 60, 61, 62] . PP1 c was also identified as part of the in vitro nuclear interactome [63] . Similarly, PPP2CA, the PP2A catalytic subunit (1.29-fold) and its regulatory subunit PP2R1A (1.27-fold) were similarly enriched upon Tat expression. Interestingly, Tat association with the PP2A subunit promoters results in the overexpression and up regulation of PP2A activity in lymphocytes [64, 65] . Furthermore, PP2A contributes to the regulation of HIV-1 transcription and replication [61, 66] . Retinoblastoma Protein. The tumour suppressor gene pRb protein displayed a 1.4-fold change in the nucleolus upon Tat expression [67] . Furthermore, WB analysis confirmed the distinct translocation of pRb from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus by Tat ( Figure 2 ). Depending on the cell type, pRb can be hyperphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated upon Tat expression and can negatively or positively regulate Tat-mediated transcription respectively [68, 69, 70] . Interestingly, the hyperphosphorylation of pRB triggers in its translocation into the nucleolus [71] . Phosphorylation of pRB is also associated with an increase in ribosomal biogenesis and cell growth [72] . STAT3. The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was significantly enriched (1.86-fold) in the nucleolar fraction by Tat constitutive expression. Furthermore, WB analysis indicated that Tat expression could promote the relocalisation of STAT3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, with a distinct enrichment in the nucleolus ( Figure 2) . Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated Tat-mediated activation of STAT3 signaling, as shown by its phosphorylation status [73] . Interestingly, STAT3 phosphorylation induced dimerisation of the protein followed its translocation to the nucleus [74] . YBX1. YBX1, the DNA/RNA binding multifunctional protein was enriched by 1.38-fold in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells upon Tat expression. Interestingly, YBX1 interacts with Tat and TAR and modulates HIV-1 gene expression [63, 75] . ZAP70. The protein tyrosine kinase ZAP70 (Zeta-chainassociated protein kinase 70) was enriched by 1.24-fold in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells expressing Tat [76] . Furthermore, WB analysis revealed that Tat expression could promote the relocalisation of ZAP70 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, with a distinct enrichment in the nucleolus ( Figure 2 ). Of note, ZAP70 is part of the in vitro nuclear Tat interactome [63] . Matrin 3. The inner nuclear matrix protein, Matrin 3 (MATR3), presented a 1.39-fold change in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells expressing Tat. It localizes in the nucleolasm with a diffuse pattern excluded from the nucleoli [77] . Matrin 3 has been identified as part of the in vitro HIV-1 Tat nuclear interactome [63] . Two recent studies have described Matrin 3 as part of ribonucleoprotein complexes also including HIV-1 Rev and (Rev Response Element) RRE-containing HIV-1 RNA, and promoting HIV-1 post-transcriptional regulation [78, 79, 80] . CASP10. The pro-apototic signaling molecule, Caspase 10 (CASP10), was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat-Tat cells (0.82-fold) [81] . Importantly, Tat expression downregulates CASP10 expression and activity in Jurkat cells [82] . ADAR1. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1), which converts adenosines to inosines in double-stranded RNA, was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat-Tat cells (0.78-fold). Interestingly, ADAR1 over-expression up-regulates HIV-1 replication via an RNA editing mechanism [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88] . Furthermore, ADAR1 belongs to the in vitro HIV-1 Tat nuclear interactome [63] . To underline the structural and functional relationships of the nucleolar proteins affected by HIV-1 Tat, we constructed a network representation of our dataset. We employed Cytoscape version 2.6.3 [89] and using the MiMI plugin [90] to map previously characterised interactions, extracted from protein interaction databases (BIND, DIP, HPRD, CCSB, Reactome, IntAct and MINT). This resulted in a highly dense and connected network comprising 416 proteins (nodes) out of the 536 proteins, linked by 5060 undirected interactions (edges) ( Figure 3A ). Centrality analysis revealed a threshold of 23.7 interactions per protein. Topology analysis using the CentiScaPe plugin [91] showed that the node degree distribution follows a power law ( Figure S5 ), characteristic of a scale-free network. Importantly, when we analysed the clustering coefficient distribution ( Figure S6 ) we found that the network is organised in a hierarchical architecture [92] , where connected nodes are part of highly clustered areas maintained by few hubs organised around HIV-1 Tat. Furthermore, node degree connection analysis of our network identified HIV-1 Tat as the most connected protein ( Figure S6 ). Specifically, the topology analysis indicated that the values for Tat centralities were the highest (Node degree, stress, radiality, closeness, betweeness and centroid), characterising Tat as the main hub protein of the nucleolar network. Indeed, a total of 146 proteins have been previously described to interact with Tat ( Figure 3B , Table S2 ). These proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including chromosomal organization, DNA and RNA processing and cell cycle control. Importantly, aver the third of these proteins exhibit an increase in fold ratio change (59 proteins with a ratio .1.2 fold). In parallel, we characterised the magnitude of the related protein abundance changes observed in distinct cellular pathways ( Figure 4) . Ribosomal biogenesis. We initially focused on ribosome biogenesis, the primary function of the nucleolus. We could observe a general and coordinated increase in the abundance of ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus by Tat expression (Figure 4 ). While some ribosomal proteins remained unaffected, Tat caused the nucleolar accumulation of several distinct large and small ribosomal proteins, except RPL35A, for which Tat expression caused a marked decrease at the nucleolar level (0.29-fold). Similarly, several proteins involved in rRNA processing exhibited an overall increase in nucleolar accumulation upon Tat expression. These include human canonical members of the L7ae family together with members participating in Box C/D, H/ACA and U3 snoRNPs ( Figure 4) . Conversely, BOP1, a component of the PeBoW (Pescadillo Bop1 WDR12) complex essential for maturation of the large ribosomal subunit, was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat TAP-Tat cells (0.81-fold) and this was confirmed by WB analysis (Figure 2 ) [93] . Nevertheless, the other PeBoW complex components, Pes1 (0.94-fold) and WDR12 (1.1fold), were not affected by Tat expression. Of note, we did not detect change in the abundance of protein participating in rDNA transcription such as RNAPOLI, UBF. Spliceosome. We identified and quantified in our dataset 55 proteins out of the 108 known spliceosomal proteins [94] . These proteins include the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins U1, U2 and U5, Sm D1, D2, D3, F and B, and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Our data suggested a distinct increase in the abundance of specific spliceosome complex proteins upon expression of HIV-1 Tat in Jurkat T-cells (Figure 3 and 4) . The only three proteins that were significantly depleted from the nucleolus upon expression of HIV-1 Tat were RBMX (0.89-fold), HNRNPA2B1 (0.84-fold) and SNRPA (0.81-fold). Several investigations showed expression alteration in cellular splicing factors in HIV-1 infected cells [95, 96] . Molecular chaperones. We have identified several molecular chaperones, co-chaperones and other factors involved into proteostasis to be highly enriched in the nucleolus of T-cells upon Tat expression (Figure 3 and 4) , many of which were previously characterised as part of the Tat nuclear interactome [63] . Several heat-shock proteins including DNAJs, specific HSP90, HSP70 and HSP40 isoforms and their co-factors were distinctively enriched in the nucleolar fraction of Jurkat cells expressing Tat ( Figure 4 ).Question: Which isotope labeled arginine?","answer":"light (R0K0)"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],M={key:0},q={key:1};function z(a,e,l,u,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",B,[(i(!0),n(b,null,w(s.filteredPoems,(r,m)=>(i(),v(p,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[o.isLoading?(i(),n("span",q,"Loading...")):(i(),n("span",M,"See more"))],8,E)):x("",!0)])}const F=h(O,[["render",z],["__scopeId","data-v-1962f986"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/22.md","filePath":"guide/22.md"}'),L={name:"guide/22.md"},G=Object.assign(L,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(i(),n("div",null,[T(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,G as default};
